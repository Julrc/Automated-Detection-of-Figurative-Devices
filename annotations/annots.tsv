In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. NA NA															
Not a nasty	dirty	wet hole	filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell	nor yet a dry	bare	sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole	and that means comfort. NA NA								
It had a perfectly round door like a porthole	painted green	with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. simile NA													
The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke	with panelled walls	and floors tiled and carpeted	provided with polished chairs	and lots and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. simile NA											
The tunnel wound on and on	going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill	as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it	first on one side and then on another. NA NA												
No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms	bathrooms	cellars	pantries (lots of these)	wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes)	kitchens	dining-rooms	all were on the same floor	and indeed on the same passage. NA NA							
The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in)	for these were the only ones to have windows	deep-set round windows looking over his garden	and meadows beyond	sloping down to the river. NA NA											
This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit	and his name was Baggins. NA NA														
The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind	and people considered them very respectable	not only because most of them were rich	but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. NA NA												
This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure	and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. NA NA														
He may have lost the neighbours’ respect	but he gained—well	you will see whether he gained anything in the end. NA NA													
The mother of our particular hobbit—what is a hobbit? NA NA															
I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays	since they have become rare and shy of the Big People	as they call us. NA NA													
They are (or were) a little people	about half our height	and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. NA NA													
Hobbits have no beards. NA NA															
There is little or no magic about them	except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along	making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. simile NA													
They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes	because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers	good-natured faces	and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner	which they have twice a day when they can get it). simile NA											
Now you know enough to go on with. NA NA															
As I was saying	the mother of this hobbit—of Bilbo Baggins	that is—was the famous Belladonna Took	one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took	head of the hobbits who lived across The Water	the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. NA NA										
It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. NA NA															
That was	of course	absurd	but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them	and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. NA NA											
They discreetly disappeared	and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses	though they were undoubtedly richer. NA NA													
Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. NA NA															
Bungo	that was Bilbo’s father	built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water	and there they remained to the end of their days. NA NA												
Still it is probable that Bilbo	her only son	although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father	got something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side	something that only waited for a chance to come out. metaphor NA											
The chance never arrived	until Bilbo Baggins was grown up	being about fifty years old or so	and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father	which I have just described for you	until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably. NA NA										
By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world	when there was less noise and more green	and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous	and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed)—Gandalf came by. NA NA												
Gandalf! NA NA															
If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him	and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear	you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. NA NA													
Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went	in the most extraordinary fashion. metaphor NA														
He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages	not since his friend the Old Took died	in fact	and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. NA NA												
He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls. NA NA															
All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. NA NA															
He had a tall pointed blue hat	a long grey cloak	a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist	and immense black boots. NA NA												
“Good Morning!” said Bilbo	and he meant it. NA NA														
The sun was shining	and the grass was very green. NA NA														
But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat. NA NA															
“What do you mean?” he said. NA NA															
“Do you wish me a good morning	or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?” NA NA														
“All of them at once	” said Bilbo. NA NA														
“And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors	into the bargain. NA NA														
If you have a pipe about you	sit down and have a fill of mine! NA NA														
There’s no hurry	we have all the day before us!” NA NA														
Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door	crossed his legs	and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill. NA NA													
“Very pretty!” said Gandalf. NA NA															
“But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. NA NA															
I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging	and it’s very difficult to find anyone.” NA NA														
“I should think so—in these parts! NA NA															
We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. NA NA															
Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! NA NA															
Make you late for dinner! NA NA															
I can’t think what anybody sees in them	” said our Mr. Baggins	and stuck one thumb behind his braces	and blew out another even bigger smokering. NA NA												
Then he took out his morning letters	and began to read	pretending to take no more notice of the old man. NA NA													
He had decided that he was not quite his sort	and wanted him to go away. NA NA														
But the old man did not move. NA NA															
He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything	till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross. NA NA														
“Good morning!” he said at last. NA NA															
“We don’t want any adventures here	thank you! NA NA														
You might try over The Hill or across The Water.” NA NA															
By this he meant that the conversation was at an end. NA NA															
“What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!” said Gandalf. NA NA															
“Now you mean that you want to get rid of me	and that it won’t be good till I move off.” NA NA														
“Not at all	not at all	my dear sir! alliteration NA													
Let me see	I don’t think I know your name?” NA NA														
“Yes	yes	my dear sir—and I do know your name	Mr. Bilbo Baggins. NA NA												
And you do know my name	though you don’t remember that I belong to it. NA NA														
I am Gandalf	and Gandalf means me! NA NA														
To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took’s son	as if I was selling buttons at the door!” metaphor NA														
“Gandalf	Gandalf! NA NA														
Good gracious me! NA NA															
Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? NA NA															
Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties	about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows’ sons? NA NA														
Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! NA NA															
I remember those! NA NA															
Old Took used to have them on Midsummer’s Eve. NA NA															
Splendid! NA NA															
They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!” simile NA															
You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe	also that he was very fond of flowers. NA NA														
“Dear me!” he went on. NA NA															
“Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? NA NA															
Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves—or sailing in ships	sailing to other shores! NA NA														
Bless me	life used to be quite inter—I mean	you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. NA NA													
I beg your pardon	but I had no idea you were still in business.” NA NA														
“Where else should I be?” said the wizard. NA NA															
“All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. NA NA															
You seem to remember my fireworks kindly	at any rate	and that is not without hope. NA NA													
Indeed for your old grandfather Took’s sake	and for the sake of poor Belladonna	I will give you what you asked for.” NA NA													
“I beg your pardon	I haven’t asked for anything!” NA NA														
“Yes	you have! NA NA														
Twice now. NA NA															
My pardon. NA NA															
I give it you. NA NA															
In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. NA NA															
Very amusing for me	very good for you—and profitable too	very likely	if you ever get over it.” NA NA												
“Sorry! NA NA															
I don’t want any adventures	thank you. NA NA														
Not today. NA NA															
Good morning! NA NA															
But please come to tea—any time you like! NA NA															
Why not tomorrow? NA NA															
Come tomorrow! NA NA															
Good bye!” NA NA															
With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door	and shut it as quickly as he dared	not to seem rude. NA NA													
Wizards after all are wizards. NA NA															
“What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he said to himself	as he went to the pantry. NA NA														
He had only just had breakfast	but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright. NA NA														
Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door	and laughing long but quietly. NA NA														
After a while he stepped up	and with the spike on his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit’s beautiful green front-door. NA NA														
Then he strode away	just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well. NA NA														
The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. NA NA															
He did not remember things very well	unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. NA NA														
Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind. NA NA															
Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell	and then he remembered! NA NA														
He rushed and put on the kettle	and put out another cup and saucer	and an extra cake or two	and ran to the door. NA NA												
“I am so sorry to keep you waiting!” he was going to say	when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. NA NA														
It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt	and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. NA NA														
As soon as the door was opened	he pushed inside	just as if he had been expected. NA NA													
He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg	and “Dwalin at your service!” he said with a low bow. NA NA														
“Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit	too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. NA NA														
When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable	he added: “I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me.” NA NA														
A little stiff perhaps	but he meant it kindly. NA NA														
And what would you do	if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation? NA NA														
They had not been at table long	in fact they had hardly reached the third cake	when there came another even louder ring at the bell. NA NA													
“Excuse me!” said the hobbit	and off he went to the door. NA NA														
“So you have got here at last!” NA NA															
That was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. NA NA															
But it was not Gandalf. NA NA															
Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open	just as if he had been invited. simile NA														
“I see they have begun to arrive already	” he said when he caught sight of Dwalin’s green hood hanging up. NA NA														
He hung his red one next to it	and “Balin at your service!” he said with his hand on his breast. NA NA														
“Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. NA NA															
It was not the correct thing to say	but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. NA NA														
He liked visitors	but he liked to know them before they arrived	and he preferred to ask them himself. NA NA													
He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short	and then he—as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful—he might have to go without. NA NA														
“Come along in	and have some tea!” he managed to say after taking a deep breath. NA NA														
“A little beer would suit me better	if it is all the same to you	my good sir	” said Balin with the white beard. NA NA												
“But I don’t mind some cake—seed-cake	if you have any.” NA NA														
“Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering	to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off	too	to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug	and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel. NA NA											
When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were brothers). simile NA															
Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them	when loud came a ring at the bell again	and then another ring. NA NA													
“Gandalf for certain this time	” he thought as he puffed along the passage. NA NA														
But it was not. NA NA															
It was two more dwarves	both with blue hoods	silver belts	and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. NA NA												
In they hopped	as soon as the door began to open—Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. NA NA														
“What can I do for you	my dwarves?” he said. NA NA														
“Kili at your service!” said the one. NA NA															
“And Fili!” added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed. NA NA															
“At yours and your family’s!” replied Bilbo	remembering his manners this time. NA NA														
“Dwalin and Balin here already	I see	” said Kili. NA NA													
“Let us join the throng!” NA NA															
“Throng!” thought Mr. Baggins. NA NA															
“I don’t like the sound of that. NA NA															
I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits	and have a drink.” NA NA														
He had only just had a sip—in the corner	while the four dwarves sat round the table	and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins	and the depredations of dragons	and lots of other things which he did not understand	and did not want to	for they sounded much too adventurous—when	ding-dong-a-ling-dang	his bell rang again	as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. NA NA						
“Someone at the door!” he said	blinking. NA NA														
“Some four	I should say by the sound	” said Fili. NA NA													
“Besides	we saw them coming along behind us in the distance.” NA NA														
The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands	and wondered what had happened	and what was going to happen	and whether they would all stay to supper. NA NA												
Then the bell rang again louder than ever	and he had to run to the door. NA NA														
It was not four after all	it was five. NA NA														
Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. NA NA															
He had hardly turned the knob	before they were all inside	bowing and saying “at your service” one after another. NA NA													
Dori	Nori	Ori	Oin	and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods	a grey hood	a brown hood	and a white hood were hanging on the pegs	and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. NA NA							
Already it had almost become a throng. NA NA															
Some called for ale	and some for porter	and one for coffee	and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while. NA NA												
A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth	the seed-cakes were gone	and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones	when there came—a loud knock. NA NA												
Not a ring	but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit’s beautiful green door. NA NA														
Somebody was banging with a stick! NA NA															
Bilbo rushed along the passage	very angry	and altogether bewildered and bewuthered—this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. alliteration NA													
He pulled open the door with a jerk	and they all fell in	one on top of the other. NA NA													
More dwarves	four more! NA NA														
And there was Gandalf behind	leaning on his staff and laughing. NA NA														
He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also	by the way	knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. NA NA													
“Carefully! NA NA															
Carefully!” he said. NA NA															
“It is not like you	Bilbo	to keep friends waiting on the mat	and then open the door like a pop-gun! simile NA												
Let me introduce Bifur	Bofur	Bombur	and especially Thorin!” alliteration NA												
“At your service!” said Bifur	Bofur	and Bombur standing in a row. alliteration NA													
Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. NA NA															
This last belonged to Thorin	an enormously important dwarf	in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself	who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur	Bofur	and Bombur on top of him. NA NA										
For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. NA NA															
Thorin indeed was very haughty	and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times	that at last he grunted “pray don’t mention it	” and stopped frowning. NA NA												
“Now we are all here!” said Gandalf	looking at the row of thirteen hoods—the best detachable party hoods—and his own hat hanging on the pegs. NA NA														
“Quite a merry gathering! NA NA															
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! NA NA															
What’s that? NA NA															
Tea! NA NA															
No thank you! NA NA															
A little red wine	I think for me.” NA NA														
“And for me	” said Thorin. NA NA														
“And raspberry jam and apple-tart	” said Bifur. NA NA														
“And mince-pies and cheese	” said Bofur. NA NA														
“And pork-pie and salad	” said Bombur. NA NA														
“And more cakes—and ale—and coffee	if you don’t mind	” called the other dwarves through the door. NA NA													
“Put on a few eggs	there’s a good fellow!” Gandalf called after him	as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. NA NA													
“And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!” NA NA															
“Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr. Baggins	who was feeling positively flummoxed	and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. NA NA													
By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays	he was getting very hot	and red in the face	and annoyed. NA NA												
“Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!” he said aloud. NA NA															
“Why don’t they come and lend a hand?” NA NA															
Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen	and Fili and Kili behind them	and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh. NA NA													
Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside	nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away)	and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. NA NA													
The dwarves ate and ate	and talked and talked	and time got on. NA NA													
At last they pushed their chairs back	and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses. NA NA														
“I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he said in his politest unpressing tones. NA NA															
“Of course!” said Thorin. NA NA															
“And after. NA NA															
We shan’t get through the business till late	and we must have some music first. NA NA														
Now to clear up!” NA NA															
Thereupon the twelve dwarves—not Thorin	he was too important	and stayed talking to Gandalf—jumped to their feet	and made tall piles of all the things. NA NA												
Off they went	not waiting for trays	balancing columns of plates	each with a bottle on the top	with one hand	while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: “please be careful!” and “please	don’t trouble! I can manage.” NA NA									
But the dwarves only started to sing: NA NA															
Chip the glasses and crack the plates! NA A															
Blunt the knives and bend the forks! NA B															
That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates– NA A															
Smash the bottles and burn the corks! NA B															
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! NA C															
Pour the milk on the pantry floor! NA D															
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! NA C															
Splash the wine on every door! NA D															
Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl; NA E															
Pound them up with a thumping pole; NA E															
And when you’ve finished	if any are whole	NA F													
Send them down the hall to roll! NA E															
That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates! NA F															
So	carefully! carefully with the plates! NA F														
And of course they did none of these dreadful things	and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning	while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. simile NA													
Then they went back	and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. NA NA														
He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings	and wherever he told one to go	it went—up the chimney	or behind the clock on the mantelpiece	or under the table	or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. NA NA										
Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin’s. NA NA															
Then Gandalf’s smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard’s head. NA NA															
He had a cloud of them about him already	and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. NA NA														
Bilbo stood still and watched—he loved smoke-rings—and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. NA NA															
“Now for some music!” said Thorin. NA NA															
“Bring out the instruments!” NA NA															
Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori	Nori	and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too	and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks. NA NA												
Dwalin and Balin said: “Excuse me	I left mine in the porch!” NA NA														
“Just bring mine in with you!” said Thorin. NA NA															
They came back with viols as big as themselves	and with Thorin’s harp wrapped in a green cloth. NA NA														
It was a beautiful golden harp	and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once	so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else	and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons	far over The Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. NA NA											
The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flickered—it was April—and still they played on	while the shadow of Gandalf’s beard wagged against the wall. NA NA														
The dark filled all the room	and the fire died down	and the shadows were lost	and still they played on. NA NA												
And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played	deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song	if it can be like their song without their music. NA NA													
Far over the misty mountains cold NA G															
To dungeons deep and caverns old NA G															
We must away ere break of day NA H															
To seek the pale enchanted gold. NA G															
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells	NA I														
While hammers fell like ringing bells simile I															
In places deep	where dark things sleep	NA J													
In hollow halls beneath the fells. NA I															
For ancient king and elvish lord NA K															
There many a gleaming golden hoard NA K															
They shaped and wrought	and light they caught NA L														
To hide in gems on hilt of sword. NA K															
On silver necklaces they strung NA M															
The flowering stars	on crowns they hung NA M														
The dragon-fire	in twisted wire NA N														
They meshed the light of moon and sun. NA M															
Far over the misty mountains cold NA G															
To dungeons deep and caverns old NA G															
We must away	ere break of day	NA H													
To claim our long-forgotten gold. NA G															
Goblets they carved there for themselves NA O															
And harps of gold; where no man delves NA O															
There lay they long	and many a song NA P														
Was sung unheard by men or elves. NA O															
The pines were roaring on the height	NA Q														
The winds were moaning in the night. NA Q															
The fire was red	it flaming spread; NA R														
The trees like torches blazed with light. Simile Q															
The bells were ringing in the dale NA S															
And men looked up with faces pale; NA S															
The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire NA T															
Laid low their towers and houses frail. NA S															
The mountain smoked beneath the moon; NA U															
The dwarves	they heard the tramp of doom. NA U														
They fled their hall to dying fall NA V															
Beneath his feet	beneath the moon. NA U														
Far over the misty mountains grim NA W															
To dungeons deep and caverns dim NA W															
We must away	ere break of day	NA X													
To win our harps and gold from him! NA W															
As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him	a fierce and a jealous love	the desire of the hearts of dwarves. NA NA													
Then something Tookish woke up inside him	and he wished to go and see the great mountains	and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls	and explore the caves	and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. NA NA											
He looked out of the window. NA NA															
The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. NA NA															
He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. NA NA															
Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up—probably somebody lighting a wood-fire—and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. NA NA															
He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End	Under-Hill	again. NA NA													
He got up trembling. NA NA															
He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp	and more than half a mind to pretend to	and go and hide behind the beer-barrels in the cellar	and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. NA NA												
Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped	and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark. NA NA														
“Where are you going?” said Thorin	in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the hobbit’s mind. NA NA														
“What about a little light?” said Bilbo apologetically. NA NA															
“We like the dark	” said all the dwarves. NA NA														
“Dark for dark business! NA NA															
There are many hours before dawn.” NA NA															
“Of course!” said Bilbo	and sat down in a hurry. NA NA														
He missed the stool and sat in the fender	knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. NA NA														
“Hush!” said Gandalf. NA NA															
“Let Thorin speak!” NA NA															
And this is how Thorin began. NA NA															
“Gandalf	dwarves and Mr. Baggins! NA NA														
We are met together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator	this most excellent and audacious hobbit—may the hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!—” NA NA														
He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit	but the compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins	who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator	though no noise came out	he was so flummoxed. NA NA											
So Thorin went on: NA NA															
“We are met to discuss our plans	our ways	means	policy and devices. NA NA												
We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey	a journey from which some of us	or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor	the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. NA NA												
It is a solemn moment. NA NA															
Our object is	I take it	well known to us all. NA NA													
To the estimable Mr. Baggins	and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili	for instance)	the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation—” NA NA												
This was Thorin’s style. NA NA															
He was an important dwarf. NA NA															
If he had been allowed	he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath	without telling any one there anything that was not known already. NA NA													
But he was rudely interrupted. NA NA															
Poor Bilbo couldn’t bear it any longer. NA NA															
At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside	and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. simile NA														
All the dwarves sprang up	knocking over the table. NA NA														
Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff	and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug	shaking like a jelly that was melting. simile NA													
Then he fell flat on the floor	and kept on calling out “struck by lightning	struck by lightning!” over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him for a long time. NA NA													
So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow	and they went back to their dark business. NA NA														
“Excitable little fellow	” said Gandalf. NA NA														
“Gets funny queer fits	but he is one of the best	one of the best—as fierce as a dragon in a pinch.” simile NA													
If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch	you will realize that this was only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit	even to Old Took’s great-grand-uncle Bullroarer	who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. Metaphor NA												
He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields	and knocked their king Golfimbul’s head clean off with a wooden club. NA NA														
It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit-hole	and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment. NA NA														
In the meanwhile	however	Bullroarer’s gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. NA NA													
After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. NA NA															
This is what he heard	Gloin speaking: NA NA														
“Humph!” (or some snort more or less like that). NA NA															
“Will he do	do you think? NA NA														
It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce	but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives	and kill the lot of us. NA NA													
I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! NA NA															
In fact	if it had not been for the sign on the door	I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. NA NA													
As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat	I had my doubts. NA NA														
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar!” NA NA															
Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. NA NA															
The Took side had won. NA NA															
He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. NA NA															
As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. NA NA															
Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now	and he said to himself: “Bilbo	you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it.” NA NA													
“Pardon me	” he said	“if I have overheard words that you were saying. NA NA													
I don’t pretend to understand what you are talking about	or your reference to burglars	but I think I am right in believing” (this is what he called being on his dignity) “that you think I am no good. NA NA													
I will show you. NA NA															
I have no signs on my door—it was painted a week ago—	and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. NA NA														
As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step	I had my doubts. NA NA														
But treat it as the right one. NA NA															
Tell me what you want done	and I will try it	if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. NA NA													
I had a great-great-great-grand-uncle once	Bullroarer Took	and—” NA NA													
“Yes	yes	but that was long ago	” said Gloin. NA NA												
“I was talking about you. NA NA															
And I assure you there is a mark on this door—the usual one in the trade	or used to be. NA NA														
Burglar wants a good job	plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward	that’s how it is usually read. NA NA													
You can say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. NA NA															
Some of them do. NA NA															
It’s all the same to us. NA NA															
Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once	and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time.” NA NA														
“Of course there is a mark	” said Gandalf. NA NA														
“I put it there myself. NA NA															
For very good reasons. NA NA															
You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition	and I chose Mr. Baggins. NA NA														
Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house	and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like	or go back to digging coal.” NA NA													
He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question	he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his bushy eyebrows	till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. NA NA													
“That’s right	” said Gandalf. NA NA														
“Let’s have no more argument. NA NA															
I have chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of you. NA NA															
If I say he is a Burglar	a Bu NA NA														
If I say he is a Burglar	a Burglar he is	or will be when the time comes. NA NA													
There is a lot more in him than you guess	and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. NA NA														
You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. NA NA															
Now Bilbo	my boy	fetch the lamp	and let’s have a little light on this!” NA NA												
On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map. NA NA															
“This was made by Thror	your grandfather	Thorin	” he said in answer to the dwarves’ excited questions. NA NA												
“It is a plan of the Mountain.” NA NA															
“I don’t see that this will help us much	” said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. NA NA														
“I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. NA NA															
And I know where Mirkwood is	and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.” NA NA														
“There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain	” said Balin	“but it will be easy enough to find him without that	if ever we arrive there.” NA NA												
“There is one point that you haven’t noticed	” said the wizard	“and that is the secret entrance. NA NA													
You see that rune on the West side	and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? NA NA														
That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.” NA NA															
(Look at the map at the beginning of this book	and you will see there the runes.) NA NA														
“It may have been secret once	” said Thorin	“but how do we know that it is secret any longer? NA NA													
Old Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.” NA NA															
“He may—but he can’t have used it for years and years.” NA NA															
“Why?” NA NA															
“Because it is too small. NA NA															
‘Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast’ say the runes	but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size	not even when he was a young dragon	certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.” NA NA												
“It seems a great big hole to me	” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes). NA NA														
He was getting excited and interested again	so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. NA NA														
He loved maps	and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. NA NA														
“How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside	apart from the dragon?” he asked. NA NA														
He was only a little hobbit you must remember. NA NA															
“In lots of ways	” said Gandalf. NA NA														
“But in what way this one has been hidden we don’t know without going to see. NA NA															
From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. NA NA															
That is the usual dwarves’ method—I think that is right	isn’t it?” NA NA														
“Quite right	” said Thorin. NA NA														
“Also	” went on Gandalf	“I forgot to mention that with the map went a key	a small and curious key. NA NA												
Here it is!” he said	and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards	made of silver. NA NA													
“Keep it safe!” NA NA															
“Indeed I will	” said Thorin	and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket. NA NA													
“Now things begin to look more hopeful. NA NA															
This news alters them much for the better. NA NA															
So far we have had no clear idea what to do. NA NA															
We thought of going East	as quiet and careful as we could	as far as the Long Lake. NA NA													
After that the trouble would begin—.” NA NA															
“A long time before that	if I know anything about the roads East	” interrupted Gandalf. NA NA													
“We might go from there up along the River Running	” went on Thorin taking no notice	“and so to the ruins of Dale—the old town in the valley there	under the shadow of the Mountain. NA NA												
But we none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. NA NA															
The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the Mountain	and out of it comes the dragon too—far too often	unless he has changed his habits.” NA NA													
“That would be no good	” said the wizard	“not without a mighty Warrior	even a Hero. NA NA												
I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands	and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce	or simply not to be found. NA NA													
Swords in these parts are mostly blunt	and axes are used for trees	and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). NA NA													
That is why I settled on burglary—especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. NA NA															
And here is our little Bilbo Baggins	the burglar	the chosen and selected burglar. NA NA													
So now let’s get on and make some plans.” NA NA															
“Very well then	” said Thorin	“supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions.” NA NA													
He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. NA NA															
“First I should like to know a bit more about things	” said he	feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside	but so far still Tookishly determined to go on with things. NA NA												
“I mean about the gold and the dragon	and all that	and how it got there	and who it belongs to	and so on and further.” NA NA											
“Bless me!” said Thorin	“haven’t you got a map? and didn’t you hear our song? and haven’t we been talking about all this for hours?” NA NA														
“All the same	I should like it all plain and clear	” said he obstinately	putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him)	and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf’s recommendation. NA NA											
“Also I should like to know about risks	out-of-pocket expenses	time required and remuneration	and so forth”—by which he meant: “What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?” NA NA												
“O very well	” said Thorin. NA NA														
“Long ago in my grandfather Thror’s time our family was driven out of the far North	and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. NA NA														
It had been discovered by my far ancestor	Thrain the Old	but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops—and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. NA NA													
Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous	and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again	and treated with great reverence by the mortal men	who lived to the South	and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. NA NA											
They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. NA NA															
Kings used to send for our smiths	and reward even the least skillful most richly. NA NA														
Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices	and pay us handsomely	especially in food-supplies	which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. NA NA												
Altogether those were good days for us	and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend	and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it	not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys	the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. NA NA											
So my grandfather’s halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups	and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of the North. NA NA														
“Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. NA NA															
Dragons steal gold and jewels	you know	from men and elves and dwarves	wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically for ever	unless they are killed)	and never enjoy a brass ring of it. NA NA										
Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad	though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can’t make a thing for themselves	not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. NA NA													
There were lots of dragons in the North in those days	and gold was probably getting scarce up there	with the dwarves flying south or getting killed	and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. NA NA												
There was a most specially greedy	strong and wicked worm called Smaug. NA NA														
One day he flew up into the air and came south. NA NA															
The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North	and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. simile NA														
Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily—a fine adventurous lad in those days	always wandering about	and it saved my life that day)—well	from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. NA NA												
Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. NA NA															
By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. NA NA															
The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. NA NA															
None escaped that way. NA NA															
The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale	and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors—the usual unhappy story	it was only too common in those days. NA NA													
Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls	and lanes	and tunnels	alleys	cellars	mansions and passages. NA NA										
After that there were no dwarves left alive inside	and he took all their wealth for himself. NA NA														
Probably	for that is the dragons’ way	he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside	and sleeps on it for a bed. NA NA												
Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale	and carry away people	especially maidens	to eat	until Dale was ruined	and all the people dead or gone. NA NA										
What goes on there now I don’t know for certain	but I don’t suppose any one lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days. NA NA														
“The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding	and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. NA NA														
They looked very grim but they said very little. NA NA															
When I asked how they had got away	they told me to hold my tongue	and said that one day in the proper time I should know. NA NA													
After that we went away	and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands	often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or even coal-mining. NA NA													
But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. NA NA															
And even now	when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off”—here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck—“we still mean to get it back	and to bring our curses home to Smaug—if we can. NA NA													
“I have often wondered about my father’s and my grandfather’s escape. NA NA															
I see now they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. NA NA															
But apparently they made a map	and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it	and why it did not come down to me	the rightful heir.” NA NA												
“I did not ‘get hold of it	’ I was given it	” said the wizard. NA NA													
“Your grandfather Thror was killed	you remember	in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin.” NA NA													
“Curse his name	yes	” said Thorin. NA NA													
“And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April	a hundred years ago last Thursday	and has never been seen by you since–” NA NA													
“True	TRUE	” said Thorin. NA NA													
“Well	your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own time and way for handing it over	you can hardly blame me	considering the trouble I had to find you. NA NA												
Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper	and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked! NA NA														
Here it is	” said he handing the map to Thorin. NA NA														
“I don’t understand	” said Thorin	and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the same. NA NA													
The explanation did not seem to explain. NA NA															
“Your grandfather	” said the wizard slowly and grimly	“gave the map to his son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. NA NA													
Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had	but he never got near the Mountain. NA NA														
How he got there I don’t know	but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer.” NA NA														
“Whatever were you doing there?” asked Thorin with a shudder	and all the dwarves shivered. NA NA														
“Never you mind. NA NA															
I was finding things out	as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. NA NA														
Even I	Gandalf	only just escaped. NA NA													
I tried to save your father	but it was too late. NA NA														
He was witless and wandering	and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.” NA NA														
“We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria	” said Thorin; “we must give a thought to the Necromancer.” NA NA														
“Don’t be absurd! NA NA															
He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together	if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. NA NA														
The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. NA NA															
The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!” NA NA															
“Hear	hear!” said Bilbo	and accidentally said it aloud. NA NA													
“Hear what?” they all said turning suddenly towards him	and he was so flustered that he answered “Hear what I have got to say!” NA NA														
“What’s that?” they asked. NA NA															
“Well	I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. NA NA														
After all there is the Side-door	and dragons must sleep sometimes	I suppose. NA NA													
If you sit on the door-step long enough	I daresay you will think of something. NA NA														
And well	don’t you know	I think we have talked long enough for one night	if you see what I mean. NA NA												
What about bed	and an early start	and all that? NA NA													
I will give you a good breakfast before you go.” NA NA															
“Before we go	I suppose you mean	” said Thorin. NA NA													
“Aren’t you the burglar? NA NA															
And isn’t sitting on the door-step your job	not to speak of getting inside the door? NA NA														
But I agree about bed and breakfast. NA NA															
I like six eggs with my ham	when starting on a journey: fried not poached	and mind you don’t break ’em.” NA NA													
After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please (which annoyed Bilbo very much)	they all got up. NA NA														
The hobbit had to find room for them all	and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas	before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether happy. NA NA													
One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else’s wretched breakfast. NA NA															
The Tookishness was wearing off	and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning. NA NA														
As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him: NA NA															
Far over the misty mountains cold NA A															
To dungeons deep and caverns old NA A															
We must away	ere break of day	NA B													
To find our long-forgotten gold. NA A															
Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears	and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. Metaphor NA														
It was long after the break of day	when he woke up. NA NA														
When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence	there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. NA NA														
Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar	and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years	ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. NA NA													
The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend	and it was popularly believed	whatever the old folk might say	that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. NA NA												
And if that was not enough for fame	there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. NA NA														
Time wore on	but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. NA NA														
At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. NA NA															
At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. NA NA															
There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. NA NA															
‘It will have to be paid for	’ they said. NA NA														
‘It isn’t natural	and trouble will come of it!’ NA NA														
But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money	most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. NA NA														
He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except	of course	the Sackville-Bagginses)	and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. NA NA												
But he had no close friends	until some of his younger cousins began to grow up. NA NA														
The eldest of these	and Bilbo’s favourite	was young Frodo Baggins. NA NA													
When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir	and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. NA NA														
Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday	September 22nd. NA NA														
‘You had better come and live here	Frodo my lad	’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.’ NA NA													
At that time Frodo was still in his tweens	as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three. NA NA														
Twelve more years passed. NA NA															
Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. NA NA															
Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one	111	a rather curious number	and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three	33	an important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’. NA NA										
Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. NA NA															
The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. NA NA															
No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee	commonly known as the Gaffer. NA NA														
He held forth at The Ivy Bush	a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority	for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years	and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. NA NA												
Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints	the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son	Sam Gamgee. NA NA													
Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. NA NA															
They lived on the Hill itself	in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End. NA NA														
‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo	as I’ve always said	’ the Gaffer declared. NA NA													
With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him	calling him ‘Master Hamfast’	and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’	especially potatoes	the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself ). NA NA											
‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater. NA NA															
‘Baggins is his name	but he’s more than half a Brandybuck	they say. NA NA													
It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland	where folks are so queer.’ NA NA														
‘And no wonder they’re queer	’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour)	‘if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River	and right agin the Old Forest. NA NA												
That’s a dark bad place	if half the tales be true.’ NA NA														
‘You’re right	Dad!’ said the Gaffer. NA NA														
‘Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed	seemingly. NA NA														
They fool about with boats on that big river – and that isn’t natural. NA NA															
Small wonder that trouble came of it	I say. NA NA														
But be that as it may	Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. NA NA														
Very much like Mr. Bilbo	and in more than looks. NA NA														
After all his father was a Baggins. NA NA															
A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him	till he was drownded.’ NA NA														
‘Drownded?’ said several voices. NA NA															
They had heard this and other darker rumours before	of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history	and they were ready to hear it again. NA NA													
‘Well	so they say	’ said the Gaffer. NA NA													
‘You see: Mr. Drogo	he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. NA NA														
She was our Mr. Bilbo’s first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. NA NA															
So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin	once removed either way	as the saying is	if you follow me. NA NA												
And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law	old Master Gorbadoc	as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles	and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded	and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.’ NA NA											
‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight	’ said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the boat.’ NA NA														
‘And I heard she pushed him in	and he pulled her in after him	’ said Sandyman	the Hobbiton miller. NA NA												
‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear	Sandyman	’ said the Gaffer	who did not much like the miller. NA NA												
‘There isn’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. NA NA															
Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. NA NA															
Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded	as you might say	among those queer Bucklanders	being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. NA NA												
A regular warren	by all accounts. metaphor NA														
Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. NA NA															
Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk. NA NA															
‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses. NA NA															
They thought they were going to get Bag End	that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. NA NA														
And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living	and never looking a day older	bless him! NA NA													
And suddenly he produces an heir	and has all the papers made out proper. NA NA														
The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see the inside of Bag End now	or it is to be hoped not.’ NA NA														
‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there	I hear tell	’ said a stranger	a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. NA NA												
‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver	and jools	by what I’ve heard.’ NA NA													
‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to	’ answered the Gaffer. NA NA														
‘I know nothing about jools. NA NA															
Mr. Bilbo is free with his money	and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. NA NA														
I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back	a matter of sixty years ago	when I was a lad. NA NA													
I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin)	but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. alliteration NA														
And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. NA NA															
I don’t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts	where there be mountains of gold	they say; but there wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. NA NA													
But my lad Sam will know more about that. NA NA															
He’s in and out of Bag End. NA NA															
Crazy about stories of the old days	he is	and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. NA NA													
Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters – meaning no harm	mark you	and I hope no harm will come of it. NA NA													
‘Elves and Dragons! I says to him. NA NA															
Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. NA NA															
Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters	or you’ll land in trouble too big for you	I says to him. NA NA													
And I might say it to others	’ he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. NA NA														
But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. NA NA															
The legend of Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits. NA NA															
‘Ah	but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first	’ argued the miller	voicing common opinion. NA NA												
‘He’s often away from home. NA NA															
And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night	and that old wandering conjuror	Gandalf	and all. NA NA												
You can say what you like	Gaffer	but Bag End’s a queer place	and its folk are queerer.’ NA NA												
‘And you can say what you like	about what you know no more of than you do of boating	Mr. Sandyman	’ retorted the Gaffer	disliking the miller even more than usual. NA NA											
‘If that’s being queer	then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. NA NA														
There’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend	if they lived in a hole with golden walls. NA NA														
But they do things proper at Bag End. NA NA															
Our Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to the party	and there’s going to be presents	mark you	presents for all – this very month as is.’ NA NA												
That very month was September	and as fine as you could ask. NA NA														
A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fireworks	what is more	such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century	not indeed since the Old Took died. NA NA												
Days passed and The Day drew nearer. NA NA															
An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. NA NA															
The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. NA NA															
It was driven by outlandish folk	singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. alliteration NA														
A few of them remained at Bag End. NA NA															
At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. NA NA															
An old man was driving it all alone. NA NA															
He wore a tall pointed blue hat	a long grey cloak	and a silver scarf. NA NA													
He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. NA NA															
Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill. NA NA															
It had a cargo of fireworks	as they rightly guessed. NA NA														
At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes	each labelled with a large red G and the elf-rune	. NA NA													
That was Gandalf’s mark	of course	and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard	whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires	smokes	and lights. NA NA										
His real business was far more difficult and dangerous	but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. NA NA														
To them he was just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. NA NA															
Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. NA NA															
‘G for Grand!’ they shouted	and the old man smiled. NA NA														
They knew him by sight	though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays – they now belonged to a legendary past. NA NA														
When the old man	helped by Bilbo and some dwarves	had finished unloading	Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming	to the disappointment of the onlookers. NA NA											
‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. NA NA															
‘You will get plenty when the time comes.’ NA NA															
Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo	and the door was shut. NA NA														
The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while	and then made off	feeling that the day of the party would never come. NA NA													
Inside Bag End	Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden. NA NA														
The late afternoon was bright and peaceful. NA NA															
The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunflowers	and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows. NA NA														
‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf. NA NA															
‘Yes	’ said Bilbo. NA NA														
‘I am very fond indeed of it	and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’ NA NA														
‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’ NA NA															
‘I do. I made up my mind months ago	and I haven’t changed it.’ alliteration NA														
‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. NA NA															
Stick to your plan – your whole plan	mind – and I hope it will turn out for the best	for you	and for all of us.’ NA NA												
‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday	and have my little joke.’ NA NA														
‘Who will laugh	I wonder?’ said Gandalf	shaking his head. NA NA													
‘We shall see	’ said Bilbo. NA NA														
The next day more carts rolled up the Hill	and still more carts. NA NA														
There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’	but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision	commodity	or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. NA NA												
People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman	hoping for invitations. NA NA														
Before long the invitations began pouring out	and the Hobbiton post-office was blocked	and the Bywater post-office was snowed under	and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. NA NA												
There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill	carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you	I shall certainly come. NA NA													
A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittance except on party business. NA NA															
Even those who had	or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. NA NA														
Bilbo was busy: writing invitations	ticking off answers	packing up presents	and making some private preparations of his own. NA NA												
From the time of Gandalf’s arrival he remained hidden from view. NA NA															
One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field	south of Bilbo’s front door	covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. NA NA													
A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road	and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. NA NA														
The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row	adjoining the field	were intensely interested and generally envied. NA NA													
Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden. NA NA															
The tents began to go up. NA NA															
There was a specially large pavilion	so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it	and stood proudly near one end	at the head of the chief table. NA NA												
Lanterns were hung on all its branches. NA NA															
More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. NA NA															
A draught of cooks	from every inn and eating-house for miles around	arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. NA NA													
Excitement rose to its height. NA NA															
Then the weather clouded over. NA NA															
That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. NA NA															
Anxiety was intense. NA NA															
Then Thursday	September the 22nd	actually dawned. NA NA													
The sun got up	the clouds vanished	flags were unfurled and the fun began. NA NA													
Bilbo Baggins called it a party	but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one. NA NA														
Practically everybody living near was invited. NA NA															
A very few were overlooked by accident	but as they turned up all the same	that did not matter. NA NA													
Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. NA NA															
Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. NA NA															
He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. NA NA															
Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays. NA NA															
Not very expensive ones	as a rule	and not so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. NA NA													
Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was somebody’s birthday	so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. NA NA														
But they never got tired of them. NA NA															
On this occasion the presents were unusually good. NA NA															
The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. NA NA															
There were toys the like of which they had never seen before	all beautiful and some obviously magical. NA NA														
Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before	and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale	and were of real dwarf-make. NA NA													
When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate	there were songs	dances	music	games	and	of course	food and drink. NA NA								
There were three official meals: lunch	tea	and dinner (or supper). NA NA													
But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together. NA NA															
At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking – continuously from elevenses until six-thirty	when the fireworks started. NA NA														
The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him	but designed and made by him; and the special effects	set pieces	and flights of rockets were let off by him. NA NA												
But there was also a generous distribution of squibs	crackers	backarappers	sparklers	torches	dwarf-candles	elf-fountains	goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. NA NA								
They were all superb. NA NA															
The art of Gandalf improved with age. NA NA															
There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. simile	alliteration NA														
There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment	and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits	disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. simile NA													
There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles	or sailing ships	or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army	and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. simile NA												
And there was also one last surprise	in honour of Bilbo	and it startled the hobbits exceedingly	as Gandalf intended. NA NA												
The lights went out. NA NA															
A great smoke went up. NA NA															
It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance	and began to glow at the summit. simile NA														
It spouted green and scarlet flames. NA NA															
Out flew a red-golden dragon – not life-size	but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws	his eyes glared down; there was a roar	and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd. NA NA												
They all ducked	and many fell flat on their faces. alliteration NA														
The dragon passed like an express train	turned a somersault	and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion. simile NA													
‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. NA NA															
The pain and alarm vanished at once	and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. NA NA														
There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone	that is	except those invited to the special family dinner-party. NA NA													
This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. NA NA															
The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits One Gross	though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related	with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ). NA NA													
Many young hobbits were included	and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late	especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. NA NA													
Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender. NA NA															
There were many Bagginses and Boffins	and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother)	and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses	Bolgers	Bracegirdles	Brockhouses	Goodbodies	Hornblowers and Proudfoots. alliteration NA								
Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo	and some had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before	as they lived in remote corners of the Shire. NA NA													
The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. NA NA															
Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. NA NA															
They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo	but so magnificent was the invitation card	written in golden ink	that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. NA NA												
Besides	their cousin	Bilbo	had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation. NA NA												
All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an inevitable item). NA NA															
He was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; and sometimes	after a glass or two	would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. NA NA													
The guests were not disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast	in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich	abundant	varied	and prolonged. NA NA											
The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of most of the stores	cellars and warehouses for miles around	that did not matter much. NA NA													
After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. NA NA															
Most of the company were	however	now in a tolerant mood	at that delightful stage which they called ‘filling up the corners’. NA NA												
They were sipping their favourite drinks	and nibbling at their favourite dainties	and their fears were forgotten. NA NA													
They were prepared to listen to anything	and to cheer at every full stop. NA NA														
My dear People	began Bilbo	rising in his place. NA NA													
‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’ they shouted	and kept on repeating it in chorus	seeming reluctant to follow their own advice. NA NA													
Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree. NA NA															
The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. NA NA															
They could all see him standing	waving one hand in the air	the other was in his trouser-pocket. NA NA													
My dear Bagginses and Boffins	he began again; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks	and Grubbs	and Chubbs	and Burrowses	and Hornblowers	and Bolgers	Bracegirdles	Goodbodies	Brockhouses and Proudfoots. alliteration NA						
‘Proudfeet!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. NA NA															
His name	of course	was Proudfoot	and well merited; his feet were large	exceptionally furry	and both were on the table. NA NA										
Proudfoots	repeated Bilbo. NA NA														
Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. NA NA															
Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! NA NA															
‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shouted	and they hammered joyously on the tables. NA NA														
Bilbo was doing splendidly. NA NA															
This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious. NA NA															
I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. NA NA															
Deafening cheers. NA NA															
Cries of Yes (and No). NA NA															
Noises of trumpets and horns	pipes and flutes	and other musical instruments. NA NA													
There were	as has been said	many young hobbits present. NA NA													
Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. NA NA															
Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits	but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. NA NA														
They contained instruments	small	but of perfect make and enchanting tones. NA NA													
Indeed	in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks	supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary)	now got up an impromptu orchestra	and began a merry dance-tune. NA NA											
Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance	but rather vigorous. NA NA														
But Bilbo had not finished. NA NA															
Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby	he blew three loud hoots. NA NA														
The noise subsided. NA NA															
I shall not keep you long	he cried. NA NA														
Cheers from all the assembly. NA NA															
I have called you all together for a Purpose. NA NA															
Something in the way that he said this made an impression. NA NA															
There was almost silence	and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears. NA NA														
Indeed	for Three Purposes! NA NA														
First of all	to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all	and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. NA NA													
Tremendous outburst of approval. NA NA															
I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. NA NA															
This was unexpected and rather difficult. NA NA															
There was some scattered clapping	but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment. NA NA														
Secondly	to celebrate my birthday. NA NA														
Cheers again. NA NA															
I should say: OUR birthday. NA NA															
For it is	of course	also the birthday of my heir and nephew	Frodo. NA NA												
He comes of age and into his inheritance today. NA NA															
Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo	’ from the juniors. NA NA														
The Sackville-Bagginses scowled	and wondered what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’. NA NA														
Together we score one hundred and forty-four. NA NA															
Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross	if I may use the expression. NA NA														
No cheers. NA NA															
This was ridiculous. NA NA															
Many of the guests	and especially the Sackville-Bagginses	were insulted	feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number	like goods in a package. simile NA											
‘One Gross	indeed! Vulgar expression.’ NA NA														
It is also	if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history	the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. NA NA													
I was only fifty-one then	and birthdays did not seem so important. NA NA														
The banquet was very splendid	however	though I had a bad cold at the time	I remember	and could only say ‘thag you very buch’. NA NA											
I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party. NA NA															
Obstinate silence. NA NA															
They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored. NA NA															
Why couldn’t he stop talking and let them drink his health? NA NA															
But Bilbo did not sing or recite. NA NA															
He paused for a moment. NA NA															
Thirdly and finally	he said	I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. NA NA													
He spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. NA NA															
I regret to announce that – though	as I said	eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the END. NA NA													
I am going. NA NA															
I am leaving NOW. NA NA															
GOOD-BYE! NA NA															
He stepped down and vanished. NA NA															
There was a blinding flash of light	and the guests all blinked. NA NA														
When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. NA NA															
One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. alliteration NA															
Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. NA NA															
Then there was a dead silence	until suddenly	after several deep breaths	every Baggins	Boffin	Took	Brandybuck	Grubb	Chubb	Burrows	Bolger	Bracegirdle	Brockhouse	Goodbody	Hornblower	and Proudfoot began to talk at once. alliteration NA
It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste	and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. NA NA														
‘He’s mad. I always said so	’ was probably the most popular comment. NA NA														
Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. NA NA															
For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank. NA NA															
But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. NA NA															
Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits	and he said to his daughter-in-law	Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this	my dear! NA NA												
I believe that mad Baggins is off again. NA NA															
Silly old fool. NA NA															
But why worry? He hasn’t taken the vittles with him.’ NA NA															
He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again. NA NA															
Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. NA NA															
For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair	and ignored all remarks and questions. NA NA														
He had enjoyed the joke	of course	even though he had been in the know. NA NA													
He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. NA NA															
But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. NA NA															
Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities	past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. NA NA														
Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party. NA NA															
He gave orders for more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo	and slipped out of the pavilion. NA NA														
As for Bilbo Baggins	even while he was making his speech	he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years. NA NA													
As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger	and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again. NA NA														
He walked briskly back to his hole	and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion	and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. NA NA													
Then he went in. NA NA															
He took off his party clothes	folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat	and put it away. NA NA													
Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments	and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. NA NA														
On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. NA NA															
From a locked drawer	smelling of moth-balls	he took out an old cloak and hood. NA NA													
They had been locked up as if they were very precious	but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. NA NA														
They were rather too large for him. NA NA															
He then went into his study	and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths	and a leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. NA NA													
The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there	already nearly full. NA NA														
Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring	and its fine chain	and then sealed it	and addressed it to Frodo. NA NA												
At first he put it on the mantelpiece	but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. NA NA														
At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in. NA NA															
‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. NA NA															
‘I wondered if you would turn up.’ NA NA															
‘I am glad to find you visible	’ replied the wizard	sitting down in a chair	‘I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. NA NA												
I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’ NA NA															
‘Yes	I do	’ said Bilbo. NA NA													
‘Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me	let alone the others. NA NA														
A little addition of your own	I suppose?’ NA NA														
‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years	and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’ NA NA														
‘And would spoil my joke. NA NA															
You are an interfering old busybody	’ laughed Bilbo	‘but I expect you know best	as usual.’ NA NA												
‘I do – when I know anything. NA NA															
But I don’t feel too sure about this whole affair. NA NA															
It has now come to the final point. NA NA															
You have had your joke	and alarmed or offended most of your relations	and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days	or ninety-nine more likely. NA NA												
Are you going any further?’ NA NA															
‘Yes	I am. I feel I need a holiday	a very long holiday	as I have told you before. NA NA												
Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return. NA NA															
In fact	I don’t mean to	and I have made all arrangements. NA NA													
‘I am old	Gandalf. NA NA														
I don’t look it	but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. NA NA														
Well-preserved indeed!’ he snorted. NA NA															
‘Why	I feel all thin	sort of stretched	if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. simile NA												
That can’t be right. NA NA															
I need a change	or something.’ NA NA														
Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. alliteration NA															
‘No	it does not seem right	’ he said thoughtfully. NA NA													
‘No	after all I believe your plan is probably the best.’ NA NA														
‘Well	I’ve made up my mind	anyway. NA NA													
I want to see mountains again	Gandalf – mountains; and then find somewhere where I can rest. NA NA														
In peace and quiet	without a lot of relatives prying around	and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. NA NA													
I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. NA NA															
I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.’ NA NA															
Gandalf laughed. NA NA															
‘I hope he will. NA NA															
But nobody will read the book	however it ends.’ NA NA														
‘Oh	they may	in years to come. NA NA													
Frodo has read some already	as far as it has gone. NA NA														
You’ll keep an eye on Frodo	won’t you?’ metaphor NA														
‘Yes	I will – two eyes	as often as I can spare them.’ NA NA													
‘He would come with me	of course	if I asked him. NA NA													
In fact he offered to once	just before the party. NA NA														
But he does not really want to	yet. NA NA														
I want to see the wild country again before I die	and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire	with woods and fields and little rivers. NA NA													
He ought to be comfortable here. NA NA															
I am leaving everything to him	of course	except a few oddments. NA NA													
I hope he will be happy	when he gets used to being on his own. alliteration NA														
It’s time he was his own master now.’ NA NA															
‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. NA NA															
‘The ring as well? NA NA															
You agreed to that	you remember.’ NA NA														
‘Well	er	yes	I suppose so	’ stammered Bilbo. NA NA											
‘Where is it?’ NA NA															
‘In an envelope	if you must know	’ said Bilbo impatiently. NA NA													
‘There on the mantelpiece. NA NA															
Well	no! NA NA														
Here it is in my pocket!’ NA NA															
He hesitated. NA NA															
‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly to himself. NA NA															
‘Yet after all	why not? NA NA														
Why shouldn’t it stay there?’ NA NA															
Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo	and there was a gleam in his eyes. NA NA														
‘I think	Bilbo	’ he said quietly	‘I should leave it behind. NA NA												
Don’t you want to?’ NA NA															
‘Well yes – and no. NA NA															
Now it comes to it	I don’t like parting with it at all	I may say. NA NA													
And I don’t really see why I should. NA NA															
Why do you want me to?’ he asked	and a curious change came over his voice. NA NA														
It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance. NA NA															
‘You are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.’ NA NA															
‘No	but I had to badger you	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘I wanted the truth. NA NA															
It was important. NA NA															
Magic rings are – well	magical; and they are rare and curious. NA NA														
I was professionally interested in your ring	you may say; and I still am. NA NA														
I should like to know where it is	if you go wandering again. NA NA														
Also I think you have had it quite long enough. NA NA															
You won’t need it any more	Bilbo	unless I am quite mistaken.’ NA NA													
Bilbo flushed	and there was an angry light in his eyes. NA NA														
His kindly face grew hard. NA NA															
‘Why not?’ he cried. NA NA															
‘And what business is it of yours	anyway	to know what I do with my own things? NA NA													
It is my own. NA NA															
I found it. NA NA															
It came to me.’ NA NA															
‘Yes	yes	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘But there is no need to get angry.’ NA NA															
‘If I am it is your fault	’ said Bilbo. NA NA														
‘It is mine	I tell you. NA NA														
My own. NA NA															
My Precious. NA NA															
Yes	my Precious.’ NA NA														
The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive	and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. NA NA														
‘It has been called that before	’ he said	‘but not by you.’ NA NA													
‘But I say it now. NA NA															
And why not? NA NA															
Even if Gollum said the same once. NA NA															
It’s not his now	but mine. NA NA														
And I shall keep it	I say.’ NA NA														
Gandalf stood up. NA NA															
He spoke sternly. NA NA															
‘You will be a fool if you do	Bilbo	’ he said. NA NA													
‘You make that clearer with every word you say. NA NA															
It has got far too much hold on you. NA NA															
Let it go! NA NA															
And then you can go yourself	and be free.’ NA NA														
‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please	’ said Bilbo obstinately. NA NA														
‘Now	now	my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘All your long life we have been friends	and you owe me something. NA NA														
Come! NA NA															
Do as you promised: give it up!’ NA NA															
‘Well	if you want my ring yourself	say so!’ cried Bilbo. NA NA													
‘But you won’t get it. NA NA															
I won’t give my Precious away	I tell you.’ NA NA														
His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword. NA NA															
Gandalf’s eyes flashed. NA NA															
‘It will be my turn to get angry soon	’ he said. NA NA														
‘If you say that again	I shall. NA NA														
Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.’ NA NA															
He took a step towards the hobbit	and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room. NA NA														
Bilbo backed away to the wall	breathing hard	his hand clutching at his pocket. NA NA													
They stood for a while facing one another	and the air of the room tingled. NA NA														
Gandalf’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. NA NA															
Slowly his hands relaxed	and he began to tremble. NA NA														
‘I don’t know what has come over you	Gandalf	’ he said. NA NA													
‘You have never been like this before. NA NA															
What is it all about? NA NA															
It is mine isn’t it? NA NA															
I found it	and Gollum would have killed me	if I hadn’t kept it. NA NA													
I’m not a thief	whatever he said.’ NA NA														
‘I have never called you one	’ Gandalf answered. NA NA														
‘And I am not one either. NA NA															
I am not trying to rob you	but to help you. NA NA														
I wish you would trust me	as you used.’ NA NA														
He turned away	and the shadow passed. NA NA														
He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man	bent and troubled. NA NA														
Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. NA NA															
‘I am sorry	’ he said. NA NA														
‘But I felt so queer. NA NA															
And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. NA NA															
It has been so growing on my mind lately. Metaphor NA															
Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. simile NA															
And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear	don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe	and pulling it out to make sure. NA NA													
I tried locking it up	but I found I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. NA NA														
I don’t know why. NA NA															
And I don’t seem able to make up my mind.’ NA NA															
‘Then trust mine	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘It is quite made up. NA NA															
Go away and leave it behind. NA NA															
Stop possessing it. NA NA															
Give it to Frodo	and I will look after him.’ NA NA														
Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. NA NA															
Presently he sighed. NA NA															
‘All right	’ he said with an effort. NA NA														
‘I will.’ NA NA															
Then he shrugged his shoulders	and smiled rather ruefully. NA NA														
‘After all that’s what this party business was all about	really: to give away lots of birthday-presents	and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time. NA NA													
It hasn’t made it any easier in the end	but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. NA NA														
It would quite spoil the joke.’ NA NA															
‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘Very well	’ said Bilbo	‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ NA NA													
He drew a deep breath. NA NA															
‘And now I really must be starting	or somebody else will catch me. NA NA														
I have said good-bye	and I couldn’t bear to do it all over again.’ NA NA														
He picked up his bag and moved to the door. NA NA															
‘You have still got the ring in your pocket	’ said the wizard. NA NA														
‘Well	so I have!’ cried Bilbo. NA NA														
‘And my will and all the other documents too. NA NA															
You had better take it and deliver it for me. NA NA															
That will be safest.’ NA NA															
‘No	don’t give the ring to me	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘Put it on the mantelpiece. NA NA															
It will be safe enough there	till Frodo comes. NA NA														
I shall wait for him.’ NA NA															
Bilbo took out the envelope	but just as he was about to set it by the clock	his hand jerked back	and the packet fell on the floor. NA NA												
Before he could pick it up	the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. NA NA														
A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit’s face again. NA NA															
Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. NA NA															
‘Well	that’s that	’ he said. NA NA													
‘Now I’m off!’ NA NA															
They went out into the hall. NA NA															
Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand; then he whistled. NA NA															
Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy. NA NA															
‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. NA NA															
‘Everything packed and labelled?’ NA NA															
‘Everything	’ they answered. NA NA														
‘Well	let’s start then!’ NA NA														
He stepped out of the front-door. NA NA															
It was a fine night	and the black sky was dotted with stars. NA NA														
He looked up	sniffing the air. NA NA														
‘What fun! NA NA															
What fun to be off again	off on the Road with dwarves! NA NA														
This is what I have really been longing for	for years! NA NA														
Good-bye!’ he said	looking at his old home and bowing to the door. NA NA														
‘Good-bye	Gandalf!’ NA NA														
‘Good-bye	for the present	Bilbo. NA NA													
Take care of yourself! NA NA															
You are old enough	and perhaps wise enough.’ NA NA														
‘Take care! NA NA															
I don’t care. NA NA															
Don’t you worry about me! NA NA															
I am as happy now as I have ever been	and that is saying a great deal. NA NA														
But the time has come. NA NA															
I am being swept off my feet at last	’ he added	and then in a low voice	as if to himself	he sang softly in the dark: Metaphor NA											
The Road goes ever on and on metaphor A															
Down from the door where it began. NA B															
Now far ahead the Road has gone	metaphor A														
And I must follow	if I can	NA B													
Pursuing it with eager feet	NA C														
Until it joins some larger way NA D															
Where many paths and errands meet. NA C															
And whither then? NA D															
I cannot say. NA E															
He paused	silent for a moment. NA NA														
Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents	and followed by his three companions went round into his garden	and trotted down the long sloping path. NA NA													
He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom	and took to the meadows	passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass. simile NA													
Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. NA NA															
‘Good-bye	my dear Bilbo – until our next meeting!’ he said softly and went back indoors. NA NA														
Frodo came in soon afterwards	and found him sitting in the dark	deep in thought. NA NA													
‘Has he gone?’ he asked. NA NA															
‘Yes	’ answered Gandalf	‘he has gone at last.’ NA NA													
‘I wish – I mean	I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke	’ said Frodo. NA NA													
‘But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. NA NA															
He always used to joke about serious things. NA NA															
I wish I had come back sooner	just to see him off.’ NA NA														
‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘Don’t be too troubled. NA NA															
He’ll be all right – now. NA NA															
He left a packet for you. NA NA															
There it is!’ NA NA															
Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece	and glanced at it	but did not open it. NA NA													
‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there	I think	’ said the wizard. NA NA													
‘You are the master of Bag End now. NA NA															
And also	I fancy	you’ll find a golden ring.’ NA NA													
‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. NA NA															
‘Has he left me that? NA NA															
I wonder why. NA NA															
Still	it may be useful.’ NA NA														
‘It may	and it may not	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘I should not make use of it	if I were you. NA NA														
But keep it secret	and keep it safe! NA NA														
Now I am going to bed.’ NA NA															
As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests. NA NA															
Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field	but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning. NA NA														
About midnight carriages came for the important folk. NA NA															
One by one they rolled away	filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. NA NA														
Gardeners came by arrangement	and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind. NA NA														
Night slowly passed. NA NA															
The sun rose. NA NA															
The hobbits rose rather later. NA NA															
Morning went on. NA NA															
People came and began (by orders) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs	and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates	and the lanterns	and the flowering shrubs in boxes	and the crumbs and cracker-paper	the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs	and the uneaten food (a very small item). NA NA									
Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses	and Boffins	and Bolgers	and Tooks	and other guests that lived or were staying near. alliteration NA											
By mid-day	when even the best-fed were out and about again	there was a large crowd at Bag End	uninvited but not unexpected. NA NA												
Frodo was waiting on the step	smiling	but looking rather tired and worried. NA NA													
He welcomed all the callers	but he had not much more to say than before. NA NA														
His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know	for good.’ NA NA														
Some of the visitors he invited to come inside	as Bilbo had left ‘messages’ for them. NA NA														
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. NA NA															
On every item there was a label tied. NA NA															
There were several labels of this sort: NA NA															
For ADELARD TOOK	for his VERY OWN	from Bilbo; on an umbrella. NA NA													
Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones. NA NA															
For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence	with love from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket. NA NA														
Dora was Drogo’s sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine	and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century. NA NA														
For MILO BURROWS	hoping it will be useful	from B.B.; on a gold pen and ink-bottle. NA NA													
Milo never answered letters. NA NA															
For ANGELICA’S use	from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex mirror. NA NA														
She was a young Baggins	and too obviously considered her face shapely. NA NA														
For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE	from a contributor; on an (empty) book-case. NA NA														
Hugo was a great borrower of books	and worse than usual at returning them. NA NA														
For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS	as a PRESENT; on a case of silver spoons. NA NA														
Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons	while he was away on his former journey. NA NA														
Lobelia knew that quite well. NA NA															
When she arrived later in the day	she took the point at once	but she also took the spoons. NA NA													
This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. NA NA															
Bilbo’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life. NA NA															
It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. NA NA															
Not	of course	that the birthday-presents were always new; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents	and kept those that he received. NA NA												
The old hole was now being cleared a little. NA NA															
Every one of the various parting gifts had labels	written out personally by Bilbo	and several had some point	or some joke. NA NA												
But	of course	most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome. alliteration NA													
The poorer hobbits	and especially those of Bagshot Row	did very well. NA NA													
Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes	a new spade	a woollen waistcoat	and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. NA NA												
Old Rory Brandybuck	in return for much hospitality	got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing	and now quite mature	as it had been laid down by Bilbo’s father. NA NA											
Rory quite forgave Bilbo	and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle. NA NA														
There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. NA NA															
And	of course	all the chief treasures	as well as the books	pictures	and more than enough furniture	were left in his possession. NA NA									
There was	however	no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away. NA NA													
Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. NA NA															
A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there	but could not be kept out. simile NA														
Labels got torn off and mixed	and quarrels broke out. NA NA														
Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them	or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched. NA NA														
The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts. NA NA															
In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. NA NA															
Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. NA NA															
When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo	Merry bowed politely. NA NA														
‘He is indisposed	’ he said. NA NA														
‘He is resting.’ NA NA															
‘Hiding	you mean	’ said Lobelia. NA NA													
‘Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him. NA NA															
Just go and tell him so!’ NA NA															
Merry left them a long while in the hall	and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons. NA NA														
It did not improve their tempers. NA NA															
Eventually they were shown into the study. NA NA															
Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. NA NA															
He looked indisposed – to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up	fidgeting with something in his pocket. NA NA														
But he spoke quite politely. NA NA															
The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. NA NA															
They began by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. NA NA															
When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away	they said the whole affair was very fishy. Metaphor NA														
‘Only one thing is clear to me	’ said Otho	‘and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it. NA NA													
I insist on seeing the will.’ NA NA															
Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir	but for the adoption of Frodo. NA NA														
He read the will carefully and snorted. NA NA															
It was	unfortunately	very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits	which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink). NA NA												
‘Foiled again!’ he said to his wife. NA NA															
‘And after waiting sixty years. NA NA															
Spoons? NA NA															
Fiddlesticks!’ NA NA															
He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s nose and stumped off. NA NA															
But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. NA NA															
A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on	and found her still about the place	investigating nooks and corners	and tapping the floors. NA NA												
He escorted her firmly off the premises	after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. NA NA														
Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say	turning round on the step	was: NA NA													
‘You’ll live to regret it	young fellow! NA NA														
Why didn’t you go too? NA NA															
You don’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a Brandybuck!’ NA NA															
‘Did you hear that	Merry? NA NA														
That was an insult	if you like	’ said Frodo as he shut the door on her. NA NA													
‘It was a compliment	’ said Merry Brandybuck	‘and so	of course	not true.’ NA NA											
Then they went round the hole	and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. NA NA														
Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson)	who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry	where he thought there was an echo. NA NA													
The legend of Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained	if not positively ill-gotten)	is	as everyone knows	anyone’s for the finding – unless the search is interrupted. NA NA											
When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out	Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. NA NA														
‘It’s time to close the shop	Merry	’ he said. NA NA													
‘Lock the door	and don’t open it to anyone today	not even if they bring a battering ram.’ NA NA													
Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea. Metaphor NA															
He had hardly sat down	when there came a soft knock at the front-door. NA NA														
‘Lobelia again most likely	’ he thought. NA NA														
‘She must have thought of something really nasty	and have come back again to say it. NA NA														
It can wait.’ NA NA															
He went on with his tea. NA NA															
The knock was repeated	much louder	but he took no notice. NA NA													
Suddenly the wizard’s head appeared at the window. NA NA															
‘If you don’t let me in	Frodo	I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill	’ he said. NA NA												
‘My dear Gandalf! NA NA															
Half a minute!’ cried Frodo	running out of the room to the door. NA NA														
‘Come in! NA NA															
Come in! NA NA															
I thought it was Lobelia.’ NA NA															
‘Then I forgive you. NA NA															
But I saw her some time ago	driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.’ Metaphor NA														
‘She had already nearly curdled me. metaphor NA															
Honestly	I nearly tried on Bilbo’s ring. NA NA														
I longed to disappear.’ NA NA															
‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf	sitting down. NA NA														
‘Do be careful of that ring	Frodo! NA NA														
In fact	it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word.’ NA NA														
‘Well	what about it?’ NA NA														
‘What do you know already?’ NA NA															
‘Only what Bilbo told me. NA NA															
I have heard his story: how he found it	and how he used it: on his journey	I mean.’ NA NA													
‘Which story	I wonder	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘Oh	not what he told the dwarves and put in his book	’ said Frodo. NA NA													
‘He told me the true story soon after I came to live here. NA NA															
He said you had pestered him till he told you	so I had better know too. NA NA														
‘‘No secrets between us	Frodo	’’ he said; ‘‘but they are not to go any further. NA NA													
It’s mine anyway.’’ ’ NA NA															
‘That’s interesting	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘Well	what did you think of it all?’ NA NA														
‘If you mean	inventing all that about a ‘‘present’’	well	I thought the true story much more likely	and I couldn’t see the point of altering it at all. NA NA											
It was very unlike Bilbo to do so	anyway; and I thought it rather odd.’ NA NA														
‘So did I. NA NA															
But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures – if they use them. NA NA															
Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. NA NA															
It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.’ NA NA															
‘I don’t understand	’ said Frodo. NA NA														
‘Neither do I	’ answered the wizard. NA NA														
‘I have merely begun to wonder about the ring	especially since last night. NA NA														
No need to worry. NA NA															
But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom	or not at all. NA NA														
At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. NA NA															
I say again: keep it safe	and keep it secret!’ NA NA														
‘You are very mysterious! NA NA															
What are you afraid of ?’ NA NA															
‘I am not certain	so I will say no more. NA NA														
I may be able to tell you something when I come back. NA NA															
I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for the present.’ NA NA															
He got up. NA NA															
‘At once!’ cried Frodo. NA NA															
‘Why	I thought you were staying on for at least a week. NA NA														
I was looking forward to your help.’ NA NA															
‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. NA NA															
I may be away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again	as soon as I can. NA NA														
Expect me when you see me! NA NA															
I shall slip in quietly. NA NA															
I shan’t often be visiting the Shire openly again. NA NA															
I find that I have become rather unpopular. NA NA															
They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. NA NA															
Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away	or worse. Metaphor NA														
If you want to know	there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.’ NA NA														
‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. NA NA															
‘You mean Otho and Lobelia. NA NA															
How abominable! NA NA															
I would give them Bag End and everything else	if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. NA NA														
I love the Shire. NA NA															
But I begin to wish	somehow	that I had gone too. NA NA													
I wonder if I shall ever see him again.’ NA NA															
‘So do I	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘And I wonder many other things. NA NA															
Good-bye now! NA NA															
Take care of yourself! NA NA															
Look out for me	especially at unlikely times! NA NA														
Good-bye!’ NA NA															
Frodo saw him to the door. NA NA															
He gave a final wave of his hand	and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent	almost as if he was carrying a great weight. simile NA													
The evening was closing in	and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Metaphor NA														
Frodo did not see him again for a long time. NA NA															
Aragorn sped on up the hill. NA NA															
Every now and again he bent to the ground. NA NA															
Hobbits go light	and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read	but not far from the top a spring crossed the path	and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking. Metaphor NA												
‘I read the signs aright	’ he said to himself. NA NA														
‘Frodo ran to the hill-top. NA NA															
I wonder what he saw there? NA NA															
But he returned by the same way	and went down the hill again.’ NA NA														
Aragorn hesitated. NA NA															
He desired to go to the high seat himself	hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. Metaphor NA														
Suddenly he leaped forward	and ran to the summit	across the great flag-stones	and up the steps. NA NA												
Then sitting in the high seat he looked out. NA NA															
But the sun seemed darkened	and the world dim and remote. NA NA														
He turned from the North back again to North	and saw nothing save the distant hills	unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air	descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth. NA NA												
Even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below	on the west side of the River. NA NA														
He stiffened. NA NA															
There were cries	and among them	to his horror	he could distinguish the harsh voices of Orcs. NA NA												
Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew	and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows	rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls. Metaphor NA													
‘The horn of Boromir!’ he cried. NA NA															
‘He is in need!’ NA NA															
He sprang down the steps and away	leaping down the path. NA NA														
‘Alas! An ill fate is on me this day	and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?’ Metaphor NA														
As he ran the cries came louder	but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. NA NA														
Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs	and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. NA NA														
Aragorn raced down the last slope	but before he could reach the hill’s foot	the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated	until at last he could hear them no more. NA NA												
Drawing his bright sword and crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed through the trees. NA NA															
A mile	maybe	from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found Boromir. NA NA													
He was sitting with his back to a great tree	as if he was resting. NA NA														
But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand	but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. NA NA														
Many Orcs lay slain	piled all about him and at his feet. NA NA														
Aragorn knelt beside him. NA NA															
Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. NA NA															
At last slow words came. NA NA															
‘I tried to take the Ring from Frodo	’ he said. NA NA														
‘I am sorry. I have paid.’ NA NA															
His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. NA NA															
‘They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. NA NA															
I think they are not dead. NA NA															
Orcs bound them.’ NA NA															
He paused and his eyes closed wearily. NA NA															
After a moment he spoke again. NA NA															
‘Farewell	Aragorn! NA NA														
Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! NA NA															
I have failed.’ NA NA															
‘No!’ said Aragorn	taking his hand and kissing his brow. NA NA														
‘You have conquered. NA NA															
Few have gained such a victory. NA NA															
Be at peace! NA NA															
Minas Tirith shall not fall!’ NA NA															
Boromir smiled. NA NA															
‘Which way did they go? NA NA															
Was Frodo there?’ said Aragorn. NA NA															
But Boromir did not speak again. NA NA															
‘Alas!’ said Aragorn. NA NA															
‘Thus passes the heir of Denethor	Lord of the Tower of Guard! NA NA														
This is a bitter end. NA NA															
Now the Company is all in ruin. Metaphor NA															
It is I that have failed. NA NA															
Vain was Gandalf’s trust in me. NA NA															
What shall I do now? NA NA															
Boromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith	and my heart desires it; but where are the Ring and the Bearer? NA NA														
How shall I find them and save the Quest from disaster?’ NA NA															
He knelt for a while	bent with weeping	still clasping Boromir’s hand. NA NA													
So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. NA NA															
They came from the western slopes of the hill	silently	creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. Simile NA													
Gimli had his axe in hand	and Legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. NA NA														
When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief	for it seemed to them plain what had happened. NA NA														
‘Alas!’ said Legolas	coming to Aragorn’s side. NA NA														
‘We have hunted and slain many Orcs in the woods	but we should have been of more use here. NA NA														
We came when we heard the horn – but too late	it seems. NA NA														
I fear you have taken deadly hurt.’ NA NA															
‘Boromir is dead	’ said Aragorn. NA NA														
‘I am unscathed	for I was not here with him. NA NA														
He fell defending the hobbits	while I was away upon the hill.’ NA NA														
‘The hobbits!’ cried Gimli. NA NA															
‘Where are they then? Where is Frodo?’ NA NA															
‘I do not know	’ answered Aragorn wearily. NA NA														
‘Before he died Boromir told me that the Orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. NA NA															
I sent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam were with him: not until it was too late. NA NA															
All that I have done today has gone amiss. NA NA															
What is to be done now?’ NA NA															
‘First we must tend the fallen	’ said Legolas. NA NA														
‘We cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.’ Simile NA															
‘But we must be swift	’ said Gimli. NA NA														
‘He would not wish us to linger. NA NA															
We must follow the Orcs	if there is hope that any of our Company are living prisoners.’ NA NA														
‘But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not	’ said Aragorn. NA NA														
‘Are we to abandon him? NA NA															
Must we not seek him first? NA NA															
An evil choice is now before us!’ NA NA															
‘Then let us do first what we must do	’ said Legolas. NA NA														
‘We have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly	or to raise a mound over him. NA NA														
A cairn we might build.’ NA NA															
‘The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water-side	’ said Gimli. NA NA														
‘Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons	and the weapons of his vanquished foes	’ said Aragorn. NA NA													
‘We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and give him to Anduin. NA NA															
The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.’ NA NA															
Quickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs	gathering their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap. NA NA														
‘See!’ cried Aragorn. NA NA															
‘Here we find tokens!’ NA NA															
He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives	leaf-bladed	damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths	black	set with small red gems. NA NA											
‘No orc-tools these!’ he said. NA NA															
‘They were borne by the hobbits. NA NA															
Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them	but feared to keep the knives	knowing them for what they are: work of Westernesse	wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. NA NA												
Well	now	if they still live	our friends are weaponless. NA NA												
I will take these things	hoping against hope	to give them back.’ Alliteration NA													
‘And I	’ said Legolas	‘will take all the arrows that I can find	for my quiver is empty.’ NA NA												
He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. NA NA															
He looked at them closely. NA NA															
And Aragorn looked on the slain	and he said: NA NA														
‘Here lie many that are not folk of Mordor. NA NA															
Some are from the North	from the Misty Mountains	if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds. NA NA													
And here are others strange to me. NA NA															
Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!’ NA NA															
There were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature	swart	slant-eyed	with thick legs and large hands. NA NA												
They were armed with short broad-bladed swords	not with the curved scimitars usual with Orcs; and they had bows of yew	in length and shape like the bows of Men. NA NA													
Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune	wrought of some white metal. NA NA														
‘I have not seen these tokens before	’ said Aragorn. NA NA														
‘What do they mean?’ NA NA															
‘S is for Sauron	’ said Gimli. NA NA														
‘That is easy to read.’ NA NA															
‘Nay!’ said Legolas. NA NA															
‘Sauron does not use the elf-runes.’ NA NA															
‘Neither does he use his right name	nor permit it to be spelt or spoken	’ said Aragorn. Alliteration NA													
‘And he does not use white. NA NA															
The Orcs in the service of Barad-dûr use the sign of the Red Eye.’ NA NA															
He stood for a moment in thought. NA NA															
‘S is for Saruman	I guess	’ he said at length. NA NA													
‘There is evil afoot in Isengard	and the West is no longer safe. NA NA														
It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. NA NA															
It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf’s fall. NA NA															
Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lórien	or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard by other paths. NA NA														
Orcs travel fast. NA NA															
But Saruman has many ways of learning news. NA NA															
Do you remember the birds?’ NA NA															
‘Well	we have no time to ponder riddles	’ said Gimli. NA NA													
‘Let us bear Boromir away!’ NA NA															
‘But after that we must guess the riddles	if we are to choose our course rightly	’ answered Aragorn. NA NA													
‘Maybe there is no right choice	’ said Gimli. NA NA														
Taking his axe the Dwarf now cut several branches. NA NA															
These they lashed together with bowstrings	and spread their cloaks upon the frame. NA NA														
Upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore	together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. NA NA														
It was only a short way	yet they found it no easy task	for Boromir was a man both tall and strong. NA NA													
At the water-side Aragorn remained	watching the bier	while Legolas and Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth Galen. NA NA													
It was a mile or more	and it was some time before they came back	paddling two boats swiftly along the shore. NA NA													
‘There is a strange tale to tell!’ said Legolas. NA NA															
‘There are only two boats upon the bank. NA NA															
We could find no trace of the other.’ NA NA															
‘Have Orcs been there?’ asked Aragorn. NA NA															
‘We saw no signs of them	’ answered Gimli. NA NA														
‘And Orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats	and the baggage as well.’ NA NA														
‘I will look at the ground when we come there	’ said Aragorn. NA NA														
Now they laid Boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. NA NA															
The grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. NA NA															
They combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. NA NA															
The golden belt of Lórien gleamed about his waist. NA NA															
His helm they set beside him	and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilt and shards of his sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. NA NA														
Then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat	they drew him out into the water. NA NA														
They rowed sadly along the shore	and turning into the swift-running channel they passed the green sward of Parth Galen. NA NA														
The steep sides of Tol Brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. NA NA															
As they went south the fume of Rauros rose and shimmered before them	a haze of gold. Metaphor NA														
The rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air. Metaphor NA															
Sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay	restful	peaceful	gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. Metaphor NA												
The stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. NA NA															
He floated by them	and slowly his boat departed	waning to a dark spot against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. NA NA													
Rauros roared on unchanging. NA NA															
The River had taken Boromir son of Denethor	and he was not seen again in Minas Tirith	standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning. NA NA													
But in Gondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool	and bore him down through Osgiliath	and past the many mouths of Anduin	out into the Great Sea at night under the stars. NA NA												
For a while the three companions remained silent	gazing after him. NA NA														
Then Aragorn spoke. NA NA															
‘They will look for him from the White Tower	’ he said	‘but he will not return from mountain or from sea.’ Then slowly he began to sing: Metaphor NA													
Through Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows Alliteration A															
The West Wind comes walking	and about the walls it goes. NA A														
‘What news from the West	O wandering wind	do you bring to me tonight? NA B													
Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?’ NA B															
‘I saw him ride over seven streams	over waters wide and grey; NA C														
I saw him walk in empty lands	until he passed away NA C														
Into the shadows of the North. NA D															
I saw him then no more. NA D															
The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.’ Alliteration E															
‘O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar	NA F														
But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.’ NA F															
From the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies	from the sandhills and the stones; NA G														
The wailing of the gulls it bears	and at the gate it moans. NA G														
‘What news from the South	O sighing wind	do you bring to me at eve? NA H													
Where now is Boromir the Fair?  NA H															
‘Ask not of me where he doth dwell – so many bones there lie NA I															
Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’ Alliteration I															
On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky; Alliteration J															
So many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea. NA J															
‘O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south	NA K														
But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea’s mouth.’ NA K															
From the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides	and past the roaring falls; NA L														
And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls. NA L															
‘What news from the North	O mighty wind	do you bring to me today? NA M													
What news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.’ NA M															
‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. NA N															
There many foes he fought. NA N															
His cloven shield	his broken sword	they to the water brought. NA O													
His head so proud	his face so fair	his limbs they laid to rest; NA O													
And Rauros	golden Rauros-falls	bore him upon its breast.’ NA P													
‘O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze NA P															
To Rauros	golden Rauros-falls	until the end of days.’ NA Q													
So they ended. NA NA															
Then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to Parth Galen. NA NA															
‘You left the East Wind to me	’ said Gimli	‘but I will say naught of it.’ NA NA													
‘That is as it should be	’ said Aragorn. NA NA														
‘In Minas Tirith they endure the East Wind	but they do not ask it for tidings. NA NA														
But now Boromir has taken his road	and we must make haste to choose our own.’ NA NA														
He surveyed the green lawn	quickly but thoroughly	stooping often to the earth. NA NA													
‘No Orcs have been on this ground	’ he said. NA NA														
‘Otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. NA NA															
All our footprints are here	crossing and re-crossing. NA NA														
I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for Frodo began.’ NA NA															
He returned to the bank	close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the River. NA NA														
‘There are some clear prints here	’ he said. NA NA														
‘A hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I cannot say how long ago.’ NA NA															
‘How then do you read this riddle?’ asked Gimli. NA NA															
Aragorn did not answer at once	but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. NA NA														
‘Two packs are missing	’ he said	‘and one is certainly Sam’s: it was rather large and heavy. NA NA													
This then is the answer: Frodo has gone by boat	and his servant has gone with him. NA NA														
Frodo must have returned while we were all away. NA NA															
I met Sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. NA NA															
He guessed his master’s mind and came back here before Frodo had gone. NA NA															
He did not find it easy to leave Sam behind!’ NA NA															
‘But why should he leave us behind	and without a word?’ said Gimli. NA NA														
‘That was a strange deed!’ NA NA															
‘And a brave deed	’ said Aragorn. NA NA														
‘Sam was right	I think. NA NA														
Frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. NA NA															
But he knew that he must go himself. NA NA															
Something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.’ NA NA															
‘Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled	’ said Legolas. NA NA														
‘He fled	certainly	’ said Aragorn	‘but not	I think	from Orcs.’ NA NA										
What he thought was the cause of Frodo’s sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did not say. NA NA															
The last words of Boromir he long kept secret. NA NA															
‘Well	so much at least is now clear	’ said Legolas: NA NA													
‘Frodo is no longer on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat. NA NA															
And Sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.’ NA NA															
‘Our choice then	’ said Gimli	‘is either to take the remaining boat and follow Frodo	or else to follow the Orcs on foot. NA NA												
There is little hope either way. NA NA															
We have already lost precious hours.’ NA NA															
‘Let me think!’ said Aragorn. NA NA															
‘And now may I make a right choice	and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!’ NA NA														
He stood silent for a moment. NA NA															
‘I will follow the Orcs	’ he said at last. NA NA														
‘I would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness	I must abandon the captives to torment and death. Metaphor NA														
My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer. NA NA															
The Company has played its part. NA NA															
Yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. NA NA															
Come! We will go now. NA NA															
Leave all that can be spared behind! NA NA															
We will press on by day and dark!’ Metaphor NA															
They drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. NA NA															
They laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. NA NA															
Then they left Parth Galen. NA NA															
The afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where Boromir had fallen. NA NA															
There they picked up the trail of the Orcs. NA NA															
It needed little skill to find. NA NA															
‘No other folk make such a trampling	’ said Legolas. NA NA														
‘It seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.’ NA NA															
‘But they go with a great speed for all that	’ said Aragorn	‘and they do not tire. NA NA													
And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.’ NA NA															
‘Well	after them!’ said Gimli. NA NA														
‘Dwarves too can go swiftly	and they do not tire sooner than Orcs. NA NA														
But it will be a long chase: they have a long start.’ NA NA															
‘Yes	’ said Aragorn	‘we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves. NA NA													
But come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. NA NA															
And woe to them	if we prove the swifter! NA NA														
We will make such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds: Elves	Dwarves	and Men. NA NA													
Forth the Three Hunters!’ NA NA															
Like a deer he sprang away. Simile NA															
Through the trees he sped. NA NA															
On and on he led them	tireless and swift	now that his mind was at last made up. NA NA													
The woods about the lake they left behind. NA NA															
Long slopes they climbed	dark	hard-edged against the sky already red with sunset. NA NA													
Dusk came. NA NA															
They passed away	grey shadows in a stony land. Metaphor  NA														
Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf’s cloak. Metaphor  NA															
He wondered if he was awake or still sleeping	still in the swiftmoving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. Metaphor  NA														
The dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. Metaphor  NA															
He could see nothing but the wheeling stars	and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of the South marched past. NA NA														
Sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of their journey	but his memory was drowsy and uncertain. NA NA														
There had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt	and then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold	and they had come to the silent town and the great empty house on the hill. NA NA													
And hardly had they reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again	and men wilted with fear. NA NA														
But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him	and he had slept in a corner	tired but uneasy	dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and Gandalf giving orders. NA NA												
And then again riding	riding in the night. NA NA														
This was the second	no	the third night since he had looked in the Stone. NA NA													
And with that hideous memory he woke fully	and shivered	and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices. NA NA													
A light kindled in the sky	a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers. NA NA														
Pippin cowered back	afraid for a moment	wondering into what dreadful country Gandalf was bearing him. NA NA													
He rubbed his eyes	and then he saw that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows	now almost at the full. NA NA													
So the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. NA NA															
He stirred and spoke. NA NA															
‘Where are we	Gandalf ?’ he asked. NA NA														
‘In the realm of Gondor	’ the wizard answered. NA NA														
‘The land of Ano´rien is still passing by.’ NA NA															
There was a silence again for a while. NA NA															
Then	‘What is that?’ cried Pippin suddenly	clutching at Gandalf’s cloak. NA NA													
‘Look! NA NA															
Fire	red fire!  NA														
Are there dragons in this land?  NA															
Look	there is another!’ NA														
For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. NA NA															
‘On	Shadowfax! NA NA														
We must hasten.  NA															
Time is short. Metaphor															
See!  NA NA															
The beacons of Gondor are alight	calling for aid. Metaphor														
War is kindled. Metaphor  NA															
See	there is the fire on Amon Dıˆn	and flame on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol	Erelas	Min-Rimmon	Calenhad	and the Halifirien on the borders of Rohan.’ NA NA									
But Shadowfax paused in his stride	slowing to a walk	and then he lifted up his head and neighed. NA NA													
And out of the darkness the answering neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard	and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the West. Simile  NA														
Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away	and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind. Simile  NA														
Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs of Gondor	and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range	and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North	or to Belfalas in the South. NA NA												
‘It is long since the beacons of the North were lit	’ he said; ‘and in the ancient days of Gondor they were not needed	for they had the Seven Stones.’ NA NA													
Pippin stirred uneasily. NA NA															
‘Sleep again	and do not be afraid!’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘For you are not going like Frodo to Mordor	but to Minas Tirith	and there you will be as safe as you can be anywhere in these days. NA NA													
If Gondor falls	or the Ring is taken	then the Shire will be no refuge.’ NA NA													
‘You do not comfort me	’ said Pippin	but nonetheless sleep crept over him. Metaphor  NA													
The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks	glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. Simile  NA														
He wondered where Frodo was	and if he was already in Mordor	or if he was dead; and he did not know that Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the day. NA NA													
Pippin woke to the sound of voices. NA NA															
Another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by. NA NA															
It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again	and chill grey mists were about them. NA NA														
Shadowfax stood steaming with sweat	but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. NA NA														
Many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him	and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. NA NA														
Partly ruinous it seemed	but already before the night was passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers	clink of trowels	and the creak of wheels. NA NA												
Torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. NA NA															
Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way	and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed. NA NA														
‘Yea truly	we know you	Mithrandir	’ said the leader of the men	‘and you know the pass-words of the Seven Gates and are free to go forward. NA NA											
But we do not know your companion. NA NA															
What is he? NA NA															
A dwarf out of the mountains in the North? NA NA															
We wish for no strangers in the land at this time	unless they be mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.’ NA NA														
‘I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘And as for valour	that cannot be computed by stature. NA NA														
He has passed through more battles and perils than you have	Ingold	though you be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of Isengard	of which we bear tidings	and great weariness is on him	or I would wake him. NA NA										
His name is Peregrin	a very valiant man.’ NA NA														
‘Man?’ said Ingold dubiously	and the others laughed. NA NA														
‘Man!’ cried Pippin	now thoroughly roused. NA NA														
‘Man! Indeed not! I am a hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man	save perhaps now and again by necessity. NA NA														
Do not let Gandalf deceive you!’ NA NA															
‘Many a doer of great deeds might say no more	’ said Ingold. NA NA														
‘But what is a hobbit?’ NA NA															
‘A Halfling	’ answered Gandalf. NA NA														
‘Nay	not the one that was spoken of	’ he added seeing the wonder in the men’s faces. NA NA													
‘Not he	yet one of his kindred.’ NA NA														
‘Yes	and one who journeyed with him	’ said Pippin. NA NA													
‘And Boromir of your City was with us	and he saved me in the snows of the North	and at the last he was slain defending me from many foes.’ NA NA													
‘Peace!’ said Gandalf. NA NA															
‘The news of that grief should have been told first to the father.’ NA NA															
‘It has been guessed already	’ said Ingold; ‘for there have been strange portents here of late. NA NA														
But pass on now quickly! NA NA															
For the Lord of Minas Tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son	be he man or——’ NA NA														
‘Hobbit	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘Little service can I offer to your lord	but what I can do	I would do	remembering Boromir the brave.’ NA NA												
‘Fare you well!’ said Ingold; and the men made way for Shadowfax	and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. NA NA														
‘May you bring good counsel to Denethor in his need	and to us all	Mithrandir!’ Ingold cried. NA NA													
‘But you come with tidings of grief and danger	as is your wont	they say.’ NA NA													
‘Because I come seldom but when my help is needed	’ answered Gandalf. NA NA														
‘And as for counsel	to you I would say that you are over-late in repairing the wall of the Pelennor. NA NA														
Courage will now be your best defence against the storm that is at hand – that and such hope as I bring. Metaphor  NA															
For not all the tidings that I bring are evil. NA NA															
But leave your trowels and sharpen your swords!’ NA NA															
‘The work will be finished ere evening	’ said Ingold. NA NA														
‘This is the last portion of the wall to be put in defence: the least open to attack	for it looks towards our friends of Rohan. NA NA														
Do you know aught of them? NA NA															
Will they answer the summons	think you?’ NA NA														
‘Yes	they will come. NA NA														
But they have fought many battles at your back. NA NA															
This road and no road looks towards safety any longer. NA NA															
Be vigilant! NA NA															
But for Gandalf Stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of Ano´rien and no Riders of Rohan. NA NA															
And you may yet. NA NA															
Fare you well	and sleep not!’ NA NA														
Gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the Rammas Echor. NA NA															
So the men of Gondor called the out-wall that they had built with great labour	after Ithilien fell under the shadow of their Enemy. Metaphor  NA														
For ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains’ feet and so back again	enclosing in its fence the fields of the Pelennor: fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes and terraces falling to the deep levels of the Anduin. NA NA														
At its furthest point from the Great Gate of the City	north-eastward	the wall was four leagues distant	and there from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river	and men had made it high and strong; for at that point	upon a walled causeway	the road came in from the fords and bridges of Osgiliath and passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. NA NA									
At its nearest point the wall was little more than one league from the City	and that was south-eastward. NA NA														
There Anduin	going in a wide knee about the hills of Emyn Arnen in South Ithilien	bent sharply west	and the out-wall rose upon its very brink; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the Harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs. NA NA												
The townlands were rich	with wide tilth and many orchards	and homesteads there were with oast and garner	fold and byre	and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to Anduin. NA NA											
Yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many	and the most part of the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the City	or in the high vales of the mountain-borders	in Lossarnach	or further south in fair Lebennin with its five swift streams. NA NA											
There dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea. NA NA															
They were reckoned men of Gondor	yet their blood was mingled	and there were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the Dark Years ere the coming of the kings. NA NA													
But beyond	in the great fief of Belfalas	dwelt Prince Imrahil in his castle of Dol Amroth by the sea	and he was of high blood	and his folk also	tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes. NA NA										
Now after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky	and Pippin roused himself and looked up. NA NA														
To his left lay a sea of mist	rising to a bleak shadow in the East; but to his right great mountains reared their heads	ranging from the West to a steep and sudden end	as if in the making of the land the River had burst through a great barrier	carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come. NA NA											
And there where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais came to their end he saw	as Gandalf had promised	the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin	the deep purple shadows of its high glens	and its tall face whitening in the rising day. NA NA											
And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City	with its seven walls of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. Metaphor  NA														
Even as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white	blushing faintly in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the City. Metaphor  NA														
Then Pippin cried aloud	for the Tower of Ecthelion	standing high within the topmost wall	shone out against the sky	glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver	tall and fair and shapely	and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze	and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets. Simile  NA								
So Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of Gondor at the rising of the sun	and its iron doors rolled back before them. NA NA														
‘Mithrandir! NA NA															
Mithrandir!’ men cried. NA															
‘Now we know that the storm is indeed nigh!’ NA NA															
‘It is upon you	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘I have ridden on its wings. Metaphor  NA															
Let me pass! NA NA															
I must come to your Lord Denethor	while his stewardship lasts. NA NA														
Whatever betide	you have come to the end of the Gondor that you have known. NA NA														
Let me pass!’ NA NA															
Then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no further	though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him. NA NA														
For the people of the City used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets	save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord. NA NA														
And they said: ‘Surely that is one of the great steeds of the King of Rohan? NA NA															
Maybe the Rohirrim will come soon to strengthen us.’ NA NA															
But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road. NA NA															
For the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven levels	each delved into the hill	and about each was set a wall	and in each wall was a gate. NA NA												
But the gates were not set in a line: the Great Gate in the City Wall was at the east point of the circuit	but the next faced half south	and the third half north	and so to and fro upwards; so that the paved way that climbed towards the Citadel turned first this way and then that across the face of the hill. NA NA												
And each time that it passed the line of the Great Gate it went through an arched tunnel	piercing a vast pier of rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided in two all the circles of the City save the first. NA NA														
For partly in the primeval shaping of the hill	partly by the mighty craft and labour of old	there stood up from the rear of the wide court behind the Gate a towering bastion of stone	its edge sharp as a ship-keel facing east. Simile  NA												
Up it rose	even to the level of the topmost circle	and there was crowned by a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might	like mariners in a mountainous ship	look from its peak sheer down upon the Gate seven hundred feet below. Simile  NA											
The entrance to the Citadel also looked eastward	but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit slope ran up to the seventh gate. Metaphor  NA														
Thus men reached at last the High Court	and the Place of the Fountain before the feet of the White Tower: tall and shapely	fifty fathoms from its base to the pinnacle	where the banner of the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain. NA NA												
A strong citadel it was indeed	and not to be taken by a host of enemies	if there were any within that could hold weapons; unless some foe could come behind and scale the lower skirts of Mindolluin	and so come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard to the mountain mass. NA NA												
But that shoulder	which rose to the height of the fifth wall	was hedged with great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end; and in that space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords	for ever silent between the mountain and the tower. NA NA												
Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city	vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than Isengard	and far more beautiful. NA NA													
Yet it was in truth falling year by year into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there. NA NA															
In every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes: names Pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there; and yet now they were silent	and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements	nor voice was heard in their halls	nor any face looked out from door or empty window. NA NA												
At last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate	and the warm sun that shone down beyond the river	as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien	glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars	and the great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. NA NA											
Gandalf dismounted	for no horse was allowed in the Citadel	and Shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master. NA NA													
The Guards of the gate were robed in black	and their helms were of strange shape	high-crowned	with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face	and above the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds; but the helms gleamed with a flame of silver	for they were indeed wrought of mithril	heirlooms from the glory of old days. NA NA									
Upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many-pointed stars. Simile  NA															
This was the livery of the heirs of Elendil	and none wore it now in all Gondor	save the Guards of the Citadel before the Court of the Fountain where the White Tree once had grown. NA NA													
Already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them; and at once they were admitted	silently	and without question. NA NA													
Quickly Gandalf strode across the white-paved court. NA NA															
A sweet fountain played there in the morning sun	and a sward of bright green lay about it; but in the midst	drooping over the pool	stood a dead tree	and the falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water. Metaphor NA											
Pippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf. NA NA															
It looked mournful	he thought	and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended. NA NA													
Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree. NA NA															
The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. NA NA															
And then he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of stone. NA NA															
They walked down a paved passage	long and empty	and as they went Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin. NA NA													
‘Be careful of your words	Master Peregrin! NA NA														
This is no time for hobbit pertness. NA NA															
The´oden is a kindly old man. NA NA															
Denethor is of another sort	proud and subtle	a man of far greater lineage and power	though he is not called a king. NA NA												
But he will speak most to you	and question you much	since you can tell him of his son Boromir. NA NA													
He loved him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. NA NA															
But under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he wishes from you rather than from me. Metaphor NA															
Do not tell him more than you need	and leave quiet the matter of Frodo’s errand. NA NA														
I will deal with that in due time. NA NA															
And say nothing about Aragorn either	unless you must.’ NA NA														
‘Why not? NA NA															
What is wrong with Strider?’ Pippin whispered. NA NA															
‘He meant to come here	didn’t he? NA NA														
And he’ll be arriving soon himself	anyway.’ NA NA														
‘Maybe	maybe	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘Though if he comes	it is likely to be in some way that no one expects	not even Denethor. NA NA													
It will be better so. NA NA															
At least he should come unheralded by us.’ NA NA															
Gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. NA NA															
‘See	Master Pippin	there is no time to instruct you now in the history of Gondor; though it might have been better	if you had learned something of it	when you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the Shire. NA NA											
Do as I bid! NA NA															
It is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will	if he comes	claim the kingship. NA NA													
Is that enough?’ NA NA															
‘Kingship?’ said Pippin amazed. NA NA															
‘Yes	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘If you have walked all these days with closed ears and mind asleep	wake up now!’ NA NA														
He knocked on the door. NA NA															
The door opened	but no one could be seen to open it. NA NA														
Pippin looked into a great hall. NA NA															
It was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either side	beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof. NA NA														
Monoliths of black marble	they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of beasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold. NA NA														
The floor was of polished stone	white-gleaming	inset with flowing traceries of many colours. NA NA													
No hangings nor storied webs	nor any things of woven stuff or of wood	were to be seen in that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone. NA NA													
Suddenly Pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of Argonath	and awe fell on him	as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead. NA NA													
At the far end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower. NA NA															
But the throne was empty. NA NA															
At the foot of the dais	upon the lowest step which was broad and deep	there was a stone chair	black and unadorned	and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. NA NA											
In his hand was a white rod with a golden knob. NA NA															
He did not look up. NA NA															
Solemnly they paced the long floor towards him	until they stood three paces from his footstool. NA NA														
Then Gandalf spoke. NA NA															
‘Hail	Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith	Denethor son of Ecthelion! NA NA													
I am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.’ NA NA															
Then the old man looked up. NA NA															
Pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and skin like ivory	and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir as of Aragorn. Simile  NA														
‘Dark indeed is the hour	’ said the old man	‘and at such times you are wont to come	Mithrandir. NA NA												
But though all the signs forebode that the doom of Gondor is drawing nigh	less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness. NA NA														
It has been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. NA NA															
Is this he?’ NA NA															
‘It is	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘One of the twain. NA NA															
The other is with The´oden of Rohan and may come hereafter. NA NA															
Halflings they are	as you see	yet this is not he of whom the omens spoke.’ NA NA													
‘Yet a Halfling still	’ said Denethor grimly	‘and little love do I bear the name	since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son on the wild errand to his death. NA NA												
My Boromir! NA NA															
Now we have need of you. NA NA															
Faramir should have gone in his stead.’ NA NA															
‘He would have gone	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘Be not unjust in your grief! NA NA															
Boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. NA NA															
He was a masterful man	and one to take what he desired. NA NA														
I journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood. NA NA															
But you speak of his death. NA NA															
You have had news of that ere we came?’ NA NA															
‘I have received this	’ said Denethor	and laying down his rod he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. NA NA													
In each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn bound with silver. NA NA															
‘That is the horn that Boromir always wore!’ cried Pippin. NA NA															
‘Verily	’ said Denethor. NA NA														
‘And in my turn I bore it	and so did each eldest son of our house	far back into the vanished years before the failing of the kings	since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw in the far fields of Rhuˆn. NA NA												
I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago	and the River brought it to me	broken: it will wind no more.’ NA NA													
He paused and there was a heavy silence. NA NA															
Suddenly he turned his black glance upon Pippin. NA NA															
‘What say you to that	Halfling?’ NA NA														
‘Thirteen	thirteen days	’ faltered Pippin. NA NA													
‘Yes	I think that would be so. NA NA														
Yes	I stood beside him	as he blew the horn. NA NA													
But no help came. NA NA															
Only more orcs.’ NA NA															
‘So	’ said Denethor	looking keenly at Pippin’s face. NA NA													
‘You were there? NA NA															
Tell me more! NA NA															
Why did no help come? NA NA															
And how did you escape	and yet he did not	so mighty a man as he was	and only orcs to withstand him?’ NA NA												
Pippin flushed and forgot his fear. NA NA															
‘The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow	’ he said; ‘and Boromir was pierced by many. NA NA														
When last I saw him he sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side. NA NA															
Then I swooned and was made captive. NA NA															
I saw him no more	and know no more. NA NA														
But I honour his memory	for he was very valiant. NA NA														
He died to save us	my kinsman Meriadoc and myself	waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed	my gratitude is none the less.’ NA NA												
Then Pippin looked the old man in the eye	for pride stirred strangely within him	still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. NA NA													
‘Little service	no doubt	will so great a lord of Men think to find in a hobbit	a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is	I will offer it	in payment of my debt.’ NA NA										
Twitching aside his grey cloak	Pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor’s feet. NA NA														
A pale smile	like a gleam of cold sun on a winter’s evening	passed over the old man’s face; but he bent his head and held out his hand	laying the shards of the horn aside. Simile  NA												
‘Give me the weapon!’ he said. NA NA															
Pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him. NA NA															
‘Whence came this?’ said Denethor. NA NA															
‘Many	many years lie on it. Metaphor NA														
Surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?’ NA NA															
‘It came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘But only evil wights dwell there now	and I will not willingly tell more of them.’ NA NA														
‘I see that strange tales are woven about you	’ said Denethor	‘and once again it is shown that looks may belie the man – or the halfling. NA NA													
I accept your service. NA NA															
For you are not daunted by words; and you have courteous speech	strange though the sound of it may be to us in the South. NA NA														
And we shall have need of all folk of courtesy	be they great or small	in the days to come. NA NA													
Swear to me now!’ NA NA															
‘Take the hilt	’ said Gandalf	‘and speak after the Lord	if you are resolved on this.’ NA NA												
‘I am	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
The old man laid the sword along his lap	and Pippin put his hand to the hilt	and said slowly after Denethor: ‘Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor	and to the Lord and Steward of the realm	to speak and to be silent	to do and to let be	to come and to go	in need or plenty	in peace or war	in living or dying	from this hour henceforth	until my lord release me	or death take me	or the world end. NA NA		
So say I	Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.’ NA NA														
‘And this do I hear	Denethor son of Ecthelion	Lord of Gondor	Steward of the High King	and I will not forget it	nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love	valour with honour	oath-breaking with vengeance.’ NA NA								
Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath. NA NA															
‘And now	’ said Denethor	‘my first command to you: speak and be not silent! NA NA													
Tell me your full tale	and see that you recall all that you can of Boromir	my son. NA NA													
Sit now and begin!’ NA NA															
As he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near his footstool	and at once servants came forward. NA NA														
Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door	unseen as he and Gandalf entered. NA NA														
‘Bring wine and food and seats for the guests	’ said Denethor	‘and see that none trouble us for one hour.’ NA NA													
‘It is all that I have to spare	for there is much else to heed	’ he said to Gandalf. NA NA													
‘Much of more import	it may seem	and yet to me less pressing. NA NA													
But maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.’ NA NA															
‘And earlier	it is to be hoped	’ said Gandalf. NA NA													
‘For I have not ridden hither from Isengard	one hundred and fifty leagues	with the speed of wind	only to bring you one small warrior	however courteous. NA NA											
Is it naught to you that The´oden has fought a great battle	and that Isengard is overthrown	and that I have broken the staff of Saruman?’ NA NA													
‘It is much to me. NA NA															
But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the East.’ NA NA															
He turned his dark eyes on Gandalf	and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two	and he felt the strain between them	almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire	drawn from eye to eye	that might suddenly burst into flame. Metaphor NA										
Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did	more kingly	beautiful	and powerful; and older. NA NA												
Yet by a sense other than sight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom	and a majesty that was veiled. NA NA														
And he was older	far older. NA NA														
‘How much older?’ he wondered	and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it before. NA NA														
Treebeard had said something about wizards	but even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them. NA NA														
What was Gandalf ? NA NA															
In what far time and place did he come into the world	and when would he leave it? NA NA														
And then his musings broke off	and he saw that Denethor and Gandalf still looked each other in the eye	as if reading the other’s mind. Metaphor NA													
But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze. NA NA															
‘Yea	’ he said; ‘for though the Stones be lost	they say	still the lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men	and many messages come to them. NA NA											
But sit now!’ NA NA															
Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool	and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cups	and white cakes. NA NA													
Pippin sat down	but he could not take his eyes from the old lord. NA NA														
Was it so	or had he only imagined it	that as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon Pippin’s face? NA NA													
‘Now tell me your tale	my liege	’ said Denethor	half kindly	half mockingly. NA NA											
‘For the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed.’ NA NA															
Pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the Lord of Gondor	stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions	and all the while conscious of Gandalf at his side	watching and listening	and (so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience. Metaphor  NA											
When the hour was over and Denethor again rang the gong	Pippin felt worn out. NA NA														
‘It cannot be more than nine o’clock	’ he thought. NA NA														
‘I could now eat three breakfasts on end.’ NA NA															
‘Lead the Lord Mithrandir to the housing prepared for him	’ said Denethor	‘and his companion may lodge with him for the present	if he will. NA NA												
But be it known that I have now sworn him to my service	and he shall be known as Peregrin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. NA NA														
Send word to the Captains that they shall wait on me here	as soon as may be after the third hour has rung. NA NA														
‘And you	my Lord Mithrandir	shall come too	as and when you will. NA NA												
None shall hinder your coming to me at any time	save only in my brief hours of sleep. NA NA														
Let your wrath at an old man’s folly run off	and then return to my comfort!’ NA NA														
‘Folly?’ said Gandalf. NA NA															
‘Nay	my lord	when you are a dotard you will die. NA NA													
You can use even your grief as a cloak. Metaphor  NA															
Do you think that I do not understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least	while I sit by?’ NA NA														
‘If you understand it	then be content	’ returned Denethor. NA NA													
‘Pride would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need; but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs. NA NA															
Yet the Lord of Gondor is not to be made the tool of other men’s purposes	however worthy. NA NA														
And to him there is no purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of Gondor; and the rule of Gondor	my lord	is mine and no other man’s	unless the king should come again.’ NA NA												
‘Unless the king should come again?’ said Gandalf. NA NA															
‘Well	my lord Steward	it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event	which few now look to see. NA NA												
In that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleased to ask for. NA NA															
But I will say this: the rule of no realm is mine	neither of Gondor nor any other	great or small. NA NA													
But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands	those are my care. NA NA														
And for my part	I shall not wholly fail of my task	though Gondor should perish	if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. NA NA												
For I also am a steward. NA NA															
Did you not know?’ NA NA															
And with that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side. NA NA															
Gandalf did not look at Pippin or speak a word to him as they went. NA NA															
Their guide brought them from the doors of the hall	and then led them across the Court of the Fountain into a lane between tall buildings of stone. NA NA														
After several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side	not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain. NA NA														
Within	upon the first floor above the street	up a wide carven stair	he showed them to a fair room	light and airy	with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. NA NA										
It was sparely furnished	having but a small table	two chairs and a bench; but at either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing. NA NA													
There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over the great curve of Anduin	still shrouded in mists	minas tirith 993 towards the Emyn Muil and Rauros far away. NA NA													
Pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep stone sill. NA NA															
‘Are you angry with me	Gandalf ?’ he said	as their guide went out and closed the door. NA NA													
‘I did the best I could.’ NA NA															
‘You did indeed!’ said Gandalf	laughing suddenly; and he came and stood beside Pippin	putting his arm about the hobbit’s shoulders	and gazing out of the window. NA NA												
Pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own	for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. NA NA														
Yet in the wizard’s face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing	were it to gush forth. Metaphor  NA														
‘Indeed you did your best	’ said the wizard; ‘and I hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men. NA NA														
Still the Lord of Gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed	Pippin. NA NA														
You could not hide the fact that Boromir did not lead the Company from Moria	and that there was one among you of high honour who was coming to Minas Tirith; and that he had a famous sword. NA NA														
Men think much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words Isildur’s Bane	since Boromir went away. NA NA														
‘He is not as other men of this time	Pippin	and whatever be his descent from father to son	by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son	Faramir	and yet did not in Boromir whom he loved best. NA NA										
He has long sight. NA NA															
He can perceive	if he bends his will thither	much of what is passing in the minds of men	even of those that dwell far off. NA NA												
It is difficult to deceive him	and dangerous to try. NA NA														
‘Remember that! NA NA															
For you are now sworn to his service. NA NA															
I do not know what put it into your head	or your heart	to do that. NA NA													
But it was well done. NA NA															
I did not hinder it	for generous deed should not be checked by cold counsel. NA NA														
It touched his heart	as well (may I say it) as pleasing his humour. NA NA														
And at least you are free now to move about as you will in Minas Tirith – when you are not on duty. NA NA															
For there is another side to it. NA NA															
You are at his command; and he will not forget. NA NA															
Be wary still!’ NA NA															
He fell silent and sighed. NA NA															
‘Well	no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring. NA NA														
For one thing	tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today	for many days to come. NA NA													
And there is nothing more that I can do to help it. NA NA															
The board is set	and the pieces are moving. Metaphor  NA														
One piece that I greatly desire to find is Faramir	now the heir of Denethor. NA NA														
I do not think that he is in the City; but I have had no time to gather news. NA NA															
I must go	Pippin. NA NA														
I must go to this lords’ council and learn what I can. NA NA															
But the Enemy has the move	and he is about to open his full game. Metaphor  NA														
And pawns are likely to see as much of it as any	Peregrin son of Paladin	soldier of Gondor. Metaphor  NA													
Sharpen your blade!’ NA NA															
Gandalf went to the door	and there he turned. NA NA														
‘I am in haste	Pippin	’ he said. NA NA													
‘Do me a favour when you go out. NA NA															
Even before you rest	if you are not too weary. NA NA														
Go and find Shadowfax and see how he is housed. NA NA															
These people are kindly to beasts	for they are a good and wise folk	but they have less skill with horses than some.’ NA NA													
With that Gandalf went out; and as he did so	there came the note of a clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. NA NA														
Three strokes it rang	like silver in the air	and ceased: the third hour from the rising of the sun. Simile  NA													
After a minute Pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about the street. NA NA															
The sun was now shining warm and bright	and the towers and tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward. NA NA														
High in the blue air Mount Mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak. Metaphor NA															
Armed men went to and fro in the ways of the City	as if going at the striking of the hour to changes of post and duty. NA NA														
‘Nine o’clock we’d call it in the Shire	’ said Pippin aloud to himself. NA NA														
‘Just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshine. NA NA															
And how I should like breakfast! 995 NA NA															
Do these people ever have it	or is it over?														
And when do they have dinner	and where?’ NA NA														
Presently he noticed a man	clad in black and white	coming along the narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. NA NA													
Pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. NA NA															
The man came straight up to him. NA NA															
‘You are Peregrin the Halfling?’ he said. NA NA															
‘I am told that you have been sworn to the service of the Lord and of the City. NA NA															
Welcome!’ NA NA															
He held out his hand and Pippin took it. NA NA															
‘I am named Beregond son of Baranor. NA NA															
I have no duty this morning	and I have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words	and to tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to know. NA NA													
And for my part	I would learn of you also. NA NA														
For never before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we have heard rumour of them	little is said of them in any tale that we know. NA NA														
Moreover you are a friend of Mithrandir. NA NA															
Do you know him well?’ NA NA															
‘Well	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘I have known of him all my short life	as you might say; and lately I have travelled far with him. NA NA														
But there is much to read in that book	and I cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. NA NA														
Yet perhaps I know him as well as any but a few. NA NA															
Aragorn was the only one of our Company	I think	who really knew him.’ NA NA													
‘Aragorn?’ said Beregond. NA NA															
‘Who is he?’ NA NA															
‘Oh	’ stammered Pippin	‘he was a man who went about with us. NA NA													
I think he is in Rohan now.’ NA NA															
‘You have been in Rohan	I hear. NA NA														
There is much that I would ask you of that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. NA NA															
But I am forgetting my errand	which was first to answer what you would ask. NA NA														
What would you know	Master Peregrin?’ NA NA														
‘Er well	’ said Pippin	‘if I may venture to say so	rather a burning question in my mind at present is	well	what about breakfast and all that? Metaphor  NA										
I mean	what are the meal-times	if you understand me	and where is the dining-room	if there is one? NA NA											
And the inns? NA NA															
I looked	but never a one could I see as 996 the return of the king we rode up	though I had been borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.’ NA NA													
Beregond looked at him gravely. NA NA															
‘An old campaigner	I see	’ he said. NA NA													
‘They say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food and of drink; though I am not a travelled man myself. NA NA															
Then you have not yet eaten today?’ NA NA															
‘Well	yes	to speak in courtesy	yes	’ said Pippin. NA NA											
‘But no more than a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but he racked me for it with an hour of questions	and that is hungry work.’ Beregond laughed. NA NA														
‘At the table small men may do the greater deeds	we say. NA NA														
But you have broken your fast as well as any man in the Citadel	and with greater honour. NA NA														
This is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war. NA NA															
We rise ere the Sun	and take a morsel in the grey light	and go to our duties at the opening hour. NA NA													
But do not despair!’ He laughed again	seeing the dismay in Pippin’s face. NA NA														
‘Those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid-morning. NA NA															
Then there is the nuncheon	at noon or after as duties allow; and men gather for the day-meal	and such mirth as there still may be	about the hour of sunset. NA NA												
‘Come! NA NA															
We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment	and eat and drink on the battlement	and survey the fair morning.’ NA NA													
‘One moment!’ said Pippin blushing. NA NA															
‘Greed	or hunger by your courtesy	put it out of my mind. NA NA													
But Gandalf	Mithrandir as you call him	asked me to see to his horse – Shadowfax	a great steed of Rohan	and the apple of the king’s eye	I am told	though he has given him to Mithrandir for his services. Metaphor  NA									
I think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men	and if his good will is of any value to this city	you will treat Shadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit	if it is possible.’ NA NA												
‘Hobbit?’ said Beregond. NA NA															
‘That is what we call ourselves	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘I am glad to learn it	’ said Beregond	‘for now I may say that strange accents do not mar fair speech	and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. NA NA												
But come! NA NA															
You shall make me acquainted with this good horse. NA NA															
I love beasts	and we see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the mountain-vales	and before that from Ithilien. NA NA													
But fear not! NA NA															
The visit shall be short	a mere call of courtesy	and we will go thence to the butteries.’ NA NA													
Pippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. NA NA															
For in the sixth circle	outside the walls of the citadel	there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept	hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of Denethor or his chief captains. NA NA												
But now all the horses and the riders were out and away. NA NA															
Shadowfax whinnied as Pippin entered the stable and turned his head. NA NA															
‘Good morning!’ said Pippin. NA NA															
‘Gandalf will come as soon as he may. NA NA															
He is busy	but he sends greetings	and I am to see that all is well with you; and you resting	I hope	after your long labours.’ NA NA											
Shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. NA NA															
But he allowed Beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks. NA NA															
‘He looks as if he were spoiling for a race	and not newly come from a great journey	’ said Beregond. NA NA													
‘How strong and proud he is! NA NA															
Where is his harness? NA NA															
It should be rich and fair.’ NA NA															
‘None is rich and fair enough for him	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘He will have none. NA NA															
If he will consent to bear you	bear you he does; and if not	well	no bit	bridle	whip	or thong will tame him. NA NA									
Farewell	Shadowfax! NA NA														
Have patience. NA NA															
Battle is coming.’ NA NA															
Shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed	so that the stable shook	and they covered their ears. NA NA													
Then they took their leave	seeing that the manger was well filled. NA NA														
‘And now for our manger	’ said Beregond	and he led Pippin back to the citadel	and so to a door in the north side 998 of the great tower. NA NA												
There they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. NA NA															
There were hatches in the walls at the side	and one of these was open. NA NA														
‘This is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the Guard	’ said Beregond. NA NA														
‘Greetings	Targon!’ he called through the hatch. NA NA														
‘It is early yet	but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his service. NA NA														
He has ridden long and far with a tight belt	and has had sore labour this morning	and he is hungry. NA NA													
Give us what you have!’ NA NA															
They got there bread	and butter	and cheese and apples: the last of the winter store	wrinkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of new-drawn ale	and wooden platters and cups. NA NA											
They put all into a wicker basket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought Pippin to a place at the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. NA NA															
From there they could look out on the morning over the world. NA NA															
They ate and drank; and they talked now of Gondor and its ways and customs	now of the Shire and the strange countries that Pippin had seen. NA NA														
And ever as they talked Beregond was more amazed	and looked with greater wonder at the hobbit	swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat	or standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below. Alliteration NA												
‘I will not hide from you	Master Peregrin	’ said Beregond	‘that to us you look almost as one of our children	a lad of nine summers or so; and yet you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could boast of. NA NA											
I thought it was the whim of our Lord to take him a noble page	after the manner of the kings of old	they say. NA NA													
But I see that it is not so	and you must pardon my foolishness.’ NA NA														
‘I do	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘Though you are not far wrong. NA NA															
I am still little more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people	and it will be four years yet before I ‘‘come of age’’	as we say in the Shire. NA NA													
But do not bother about me. NA NA															
Come and look and tell me what I can see.’ NA NA															
The sun was now climbing	and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up. Metaphor NA														
The last of them were floating away	just overhead	as wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the East	that was now flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. NA NA												
Away down in the valley-bottom	five leagues or so as the eye leaps	the Great River could now be seen grey and glittering	coming out of the north-west	and bending in a mighty sweep south and west again	till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer	far beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away. NA NA									
Pippin could see all the Pelennor laid out before him	dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls	barns and byres	but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts. NA NA												
Many roads and tracks crossed the green fields	and there was much coming and going: wains moving in lines towards the Great Gate	and others passing out. NA NA													
Now and again a horseman would ride up	and leap from the saddle and hasten into the City. NA NA														
But most of the traffic went out along the chief highway	and that turned south	and then bending swifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from sight. Alliteration NA													
It was wide and well-paved	and along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding-track	and beyond that a wall. NA NA													
On the ride horsemen galloped to and fro	but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south. NA NA														
But soon Pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the wains were moving in three lines	one swifter drawn by horses; another slower	great waggons with fair housings of many colours	drawn by oxen; and along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men. NA NA												
‘That is the road to the vales of Tumladen and Lossarnach	and the mountain-villages	and then on to Lebennin	’ said Beregond. NA NA												
‘There go the last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged	the children	and the women that must go with them. NA NA													
They must all be gone from the Gate and the road clear for a league before noon: that was the order. NA NA															
It is a sad necessity.’ He sighed. NA NA															
‘Few	maybe	of those now sundered will meet again. NA NA													
And there were always too few children 1000 the return of the king in this city; but now there are none – save some young lads that will not depart	and may find some task to do: my own son is one of them.’ NA NA														
They fell silent for a while. Metaphor NA															
Pippin gazed anxiously eastward	as if at any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields. NA NA														
‘What can I see there?’ he asked	pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the Anduin. NA NA														
‘Is that another city	or what is it?’ NA NA														
‘It was a city	’ said Beregond	‘the chief city of Gondor	of which this was only a fortress. NA NA												
For that is the ruin of Osgiliath on either side of Anduin	which our enemies took and burned long ago. NA NA														
Yet we won it back in the days of the youth of Denethor: not to dwell in	but to hold as an outpost	and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. NA NA													
And then came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.’ NA NA															
‘The Black Riders?’ said Pippin	opening his eyes	and they were wide and dark with an old fear re-awakened. NA NA													
‘Yes	they were black	’ said Beregond	‘and I see that you know something of them	though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.’ NA NA											
‘I know of them	’ said Pippin softly	‘but I will not speak of them now	so near	so near.’ NA NA											
He broke off and lifted his eyes above the River	and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow. Metaphor NA														
Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight	their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall	and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. NA NA													
But even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering	very slowly	slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun. NA NA													
‘So near to Mordor?’ said Beregond quietly. NA NA															
‘Yes	there it lies. NA NA														
We seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it seems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. NA NA															
It is growing and darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. NA NA															
And the Fell Riders	less than a year ago they won back the crossings	and many of our best men were slain. NA NA													
Boromir it was that 1001 drove the enemy at last back from this western shore	and we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. NA NA														
For a little while. NA NA															
But we await now a new onslaught there. NA NA															
Maybe the chief onslaught of the war that comes.’ NA NA															
‘When?’ said Pippin. NA NA															
‘Have you a guess? NA NA															
For I saw the beacons two nights ago and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a sign that war had begun. NA NA															
He seemed in a desperate hurry. NA NA															
But now everything seems to have slowed up again.’ NA NA															
‘Only because everything is now ready	’ said Beregond. NA NA														
‘It is but the deep breath before the plunge.’ Metaphor  NA															
‘But why were the beacons lit two nights ago?’ NA NA															
‘It is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged	’ answered Beregond. NA NA														
‘But I do not know the counsel of the Lord and his captains. NA NA															
They have many ways of gathering news. NA NA															
And the Lord Denethor is unlike other men: he sees far. NA NA															
Some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the Tower at night	and bends his thought this way and that	he can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the mind of the Enemy	wrestling with him. NA NA												
And so it is that he is old	worn before his time. NA NA														
But however that may be	my lord Faramir is abroad	beyond the River on some perilous errand	and he may have sent tidings. NA NA												
‘But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze	it was the news that came that eve out of Lebennin. NA NA														
There is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of Anduin	manned by the corsairs of Umbar in the South. NA NA														
They have long ceased to fear the might of Gondor	and they have allied them with the Enemy	and now make a heavy stroke in his cause. Metaphor NA													
For this attack will draw off much of the help that we looked to have from Lebennin and Belfalas	where folk are hardy and numerous. NA NA														
All the more do our thoughts go north to Rohan; and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you bring. NA NA															
‘And yet’ – he paused and stood up	and looked round	north	east	and south – ‘the doings at Isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategy. Metaphor  NA											
This is no longer a bickering at the fords	raiding from Ithilien and from Ano´rien	ambushing and pillaging. NA NA													
This is a great war long-planned	and we are but one piece in it	whatever pride may say. NA NA													
Things move in the far East beyond the Inland Sea	it is reported; and north in Mirkwood and beyond; and south in Harad. NA NA														
And now all realms shall be put to the test	to stand	or fall – under the Shadow. NA NA													
‘Yet	Master Peregrin	we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt of the chief hatred of the Dark Lord	for that hatred comes down out of the depths of time and over the deeps of the Sea. Alliteration NA												
Here will the hammer-stroke fall hardest. Metaphor  NA															
And for that reason Mithrandir came hither in such haste. NA NA															
For if we fall	who shall stand? NA NA														
And	Master Peregrin	do you see any hope that we shall stand?’ NA NA													
Pippin did not answer. NA NA															
He looked at the great walls	and the towers and brave banners	and the sun in the high sky	and then at the gathering gloom in the East; and he thought of the long fingers of that Shadow: of the orcs in the woods and the mountains	the treason of Isengard	the birds of evil eye	and the Black Riders even in the lanes of the Shire – and of the winged terror	the Nazguˆl. Metaphor  NA								
He shuddered	and hope seemed to wither. Metaphor  NA														
And even at that moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured	as though a dark wing had passed across it. Simile NA														
Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught	high and far up in the heavens	a cry: faint	but heart-quelling	cruel and cold. NA NA											
He blanched and cowered against the wall. NA NA															
‘What was that?’ asked Beregond. NA NA															
‘You also felt something?’ NA NA															
‘Yes	’ muttered Pippin. NA NA														
‘It is the sign of our fall	and the shadow of doom	a Fell Rider of the air.’ NA NA													
‘Yes	the shadow of doom	’ said Beregond. NA NA													
‘I fear that Minas Tirith shall fall. NA NA															
Night comes. NA NA															
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.’ NA NA															
For a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. NA NA															
Then suddenly Pippin looked up and saw that the sun minas tirith 1003 was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze. NA NA															
He shook himself. NA NA															
‘It is passed	’ he said. NA NA														
‘No	my heart will not yet despair. NA NA														
Gandalf fell and has returned and is with us. NA NA															
We may stand	if only on one leg	or at least be left still upon our knees.’ NA NA													
‘Rightly said!’ cried Beregond	rising and striding to and fro. NA NA														
‘Nay	though all things must come utterly to an end in time	Gondor shall not perish yet. NA NA													
Not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion before them. NA NA															
There are still other fastnesses	and secret ways of escape into the mountains. NA NA														
Hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green.’ NA NA															
‘All the same	I wish it was over for good or ill	’ said Pippin. NA NA													
‘I am no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge of one that I can’t escape is worst of all. NA NA															
What a long day it seems already! NA NA															
I should be happier	if we were not obliged to stand and watch	making no move	striking nowhere first. NA NA												
No stroke would have been struck in Rohan	I think	but for Gandalf.’ NA NA													
‘Ah	there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!’ said Beregond. NA NA														
‘But things may change when Faramir returns. NA NA															
He is bold	more bold than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song	as he is	and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field. NA NA												
But such is Faramir. NA NA															
Less reckless and eager than Boromir	but not less resolute. NA NA														
Yet what indeed can he do? NA NA															
We cannot assault the mountains of – of yonder realm. NA NA															
Our reach is shortened	and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it. NA NA														
Then our hand must be heavy!’ Metaphor NA															
He smote the hilt of his sword. NA NA															
Pippin looked at him: tall and proud and noble	as all the men that he had yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle. Metaphor NA														
‘Alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather	’ he thought	but he said nothing. Simile  NA													
‘A pawn did Gandalf say? NA NA															
Perhaps; but on the wrong chessboard.’ Metaphor  NA															
1004 the return of the king So they talked until the sun reached its height	and suddenly the noon-bells were rung	and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the watchmen were going to their meal. NA NA													
‘Will you come with me?’ said Beregond. NA NA															
‘You may join my mess for this day. NA NA															
I do not know to what company you will be assigned; or the Lord may hold you at his own command. NA NA															
But you will be welcome. NA NA															
And it will be well to meet as many men as you may	while there is yet time.’ NA NA														
‘I shall be glad to come	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘I am lonely	to tell you the truth. NA NA														
I left my best friend behind in Rohan	and I have had no one to talk to or jest with. NA NA														
Perhaps I could really join your company? NA NA															
Are you the captain? NA NA															
If so	you could take me on	or speak for me?’ NA NA													
‘Nay	nay	’ Beregond laughed	‘I am no captain. NA NA												
Neither office nor rank nor lordship have I	being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of the Citadel. NA NA														
Yet	Master Peregrin	to be only a man of arms of the Guard of the Tower of Gondor is held worthy in the City	and such men have honour in the land.’ NA NA												
‘Then it is far beyond me	’ said Pippin. NA NA														
‘Take me back to our room	and if Gandalf is not there	I will go where you like – as your guest.’ NA NA													
Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin went with Beregond and was made known to the men of the Third Company. NA NA															
And it seemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest	for Pippin was very welcome. NA NA														
There had already been much talk in the citadel about Mithrandir’s companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour declared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer allegiance to Gondor and five thousand swords. NA NA															
And some said that when the Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior	small maybe	but doughty. NA NA													
Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale	he could not be rid of his new rank	only fitting	men thought	to one befriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord minas tirith 1005 Denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them	and hung on his words and stories of the outlands	and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. NA NA									
Indeed his only trouble was to be ‘wary’ according to the counsel of Gandalf	and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends. NA NA														
At length Beregond rose. NA NA															
‘Farewell for this time!’ he said. NA NA															
‘I have duty now till sundown	as have all the others here	I think. NA NA													
But if you are lonely	as you say	maybe you would like a merry guide about the City. NA NA													
My son would go with you gladly. NA NA															
A good lad	I may say. NA NA														
If that pleases you	go down to the lowest circle and ask for the Old Guesthouse in the Rath Celerdain	the Lampwrights’ Street. NA NA													
You will find him there with other lads that are remaining in the City. NA NA															
There may be things worth seeing down at the Great Gate ere the closing.’ NA NA															
He went out	and soon after all the others followed. NA NA														
The day was still fine	though it was growing hazy	and it was hot for March	even so far southwards. NA NA												
Pippin felt sleepy	but the lodging seemed cheerless	and he decided to go down and explore the City. NA NA													
He took a few morsels that he had saved to Shadowfax	and they were graciously accepted	though the horse seemed to have no lack. NA NA													
Then he walked on down many winding ways. NA NA															
People stared much as he passed. NA NA															
To his face men were gravely courteous	saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands upon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls	as those out of doors cried to others within to come and see the Prince of the Halflings	the companion of Mithrandir. NA NA												
Many used some other tongue than the Common Speech	but it was not long before he learned at least what was meant by Ernil i Pheriannath and knew that his title had gone down before him into the City. NA NA														
He came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to the lowest and widest circle	and there he was directed to the Lampwrights’ Street	a broad way running 1006 towards the Great Gate. NA NA													
In it he found the Old Guesthouse	a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running back from the street	and between them a narrow greensward	behind which was the many-windowed house	fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass. NA NA											
Boys were playing among the pillars	the only children that Pippin had seen in Minas Tirith	and he stopped to look at them. NA NA													
Presently one of them caught sight of him	and with a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street	followed by several others. NA NA													
There he stood in front of Pippin	looking him up and down. NA NA														
‘Greetings!’ said the lad. NA NA															
‘Where do you come from? NA NA															
You are a stranger in the City.’ NA NA															
‘I was	’ said Pippin; ‘but they say I have become a man of Gondor.’ NA NA														
‘Oh come!’ said the lad. NA NA															
‘Then we are all men here. NA NA															
But how old are you	and what is your name? NA NA														
I am ten years already	and shall soon be five feet. NA NA														
I am taller than you. NA NA															
But then my father is a Guard	one of the tallest. NA NA														
What is your father?’ NA NA															
‘Which question shall I answer first?’ said Pippin. NA NA															
‘My father farms the lands round Whitwell near Tuckborough in the Shire. NA NA															
I am nearly twenty-nine	so I pass you there; though I am but four feet	and not likely to grow any more	save sideways.’ NA NA												
‘Twenty-nine!’ said the lad and whistled. NA NA															
‘Why	you are quite old! NA NA														
As old as my uncle Iorlas. NA NA															
Still	’ he added hopefully	‘I wager I could stand you on your head or lay you on your back.’ NA NA													
‘Maybe you could	if I let you	’ said Pippin with a laugh. NA NA													
‘And maybe I could do the same to you: we know some wrestling tricks in my little country. NA NA															
Where	let me tell you	I am considered uncommonly large and strong; and I have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head. NA NA													
So if it came to a trial and nothing else would serve	I might have to kill you. NA NA														
For when you are older	you will learn that folk are not always what they seem; and though you may have taken me minas tirith 1007 for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey	let me warn you: I am not	I am a halfling	hard	bold	and wicked!’ NA NA									
Pippin pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace	but at once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye. NA NA														
‘No!’ Pippin laughed. NA NA															
‘Don’t believe what strangers say of themselves either! NA NA															
I am not a fighter. NA NA															
But it would be politer in any case for the challenger to say who he is.’ NA NA															
The boy drew himself up proudly. NA NA															
‘I am Bergil son of Beregond of the Guards	’ he said. NA NA														
‘So I thought	’ said Pippin	‘for you look like your father. NA NA													
I know him and he sent me to find you.’ NA NA															
‘Then why did you not say so at once?’ said Bergil	and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face. NA NA														
‘Do not tell me that he has changed his mind	and will send me away with the maidens! NA NA														
But no	the last wains have gone.’ NA NA														
‘His message is less bad than that	if not good	’ said Pippin. NA NA													
‘He says that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head	you might show me round the City for a while and cheer my loneliness. NA NA														
I can tell you some tales of far countries in return.’ NA NA															
Bergil clapped his hands	and laughed with relief. NA NA														
‘All is well	’ he cried. NA NA														
‘Come then! NA NA															
We were soon going to the Gate to look on. NA NA															
We will go now.’ NA NA															
‘What is happening there?’ NA NA															
‘The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Road ere sundown. NA NA															
Come with us and you will see.’ NA NA															
Bergil proved a good comrade	the best company Pippin had had since he parted from Merry	and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets	heedless of the many glances that men gave them. NA NA												
Before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the Great Gate. NA NA															
There Pippin went up much in the esteem of Bergil	for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more	he allowed him to take his companion with him. NA NA													
‘That is good!’ said Bergil. NA NA															
‘We boys are no longer allowed to pass the Gate without an elder. NA NA															
Now we shall see better.’ NA NA															
Beyond the Gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved space into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran. NA NA															
All eyes were turned southwards	and soon a murmur rose: ‘There is dust away there! NA NA														
They are coming!’ NA NA															
Pippin and Bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd	and waited. NA NA														
Horns sounded at some distance	and the noise of cheering rolled towards them like a gathering wind. Simile  NA														
Then there was a loud trumpet-blast	and all about them people were shouting. NA NA														
‘Forlong! NA NA															
Forlong!’ Pippin heard men calling. NA NA															
‘What do they say?’ he asked. NA NA															
‘Forlong has come	’ Bergil answered; ‘old Forlong the Fat	the Lord of Lossarnach. Alliteration NA													
That is where my grandsire lives. NA NA															
Hurrah! NA NA															
Here he is. NA NA															
Good old Forlong!’ NA NA															
Leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse	and on it sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth	but old and grey-bearded	yet mail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear. NA NA												
Behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men	well-armed and bearing great battle-axes; grim-faced they were	and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any men that Pippin had yet seen in Gondor. NA NA													
‘Forlong!’ men shouted. NA NA															
‘True heart	true friend! NA NA														
Forlong!’ NA NA															
But when the men of Lossarnach had passed they muttered: ‘So few! NA NA															
Two hundreds	what are they? NA NA														
We hoped for ten times the number. NA NA															
That will be the new tidings of the black fleet. NA NA															
They are sparing only a tithe of their strength. NA NA															
Still every little is a gain.’ NA NA															
And so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the Gate	men of the Outlands marching to defend the City of Gondor in a dark hour; but always too few	always less than hope looked for or need asked. NA NA													
The men of Ringlo´ Vale behind the son of their lord	Dervorin striding on foot: three hundreds. NA NA														
From the uplands minas tirith 1009 of Morthond	the great Blackroot Vale	tall Duinhir with his sons	Duilin and Derufin	and five hundred bowmen. NA NA											
From the Anfalas	the Langstrand far away	a long line of men of many sorts	hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages	scantily equipped save for the household of Golasgil their lord. NA NA											
From Lamedon	a few grim hillmen without a captain. NA NA														
Fisher-folk of the Ethir	some hundred or more spared from the ships. NA NA														
Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from Pinnath Gelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad men. Alliteration NA															
And last and proudest	Imrahil	Prince of Dol Amroth	kinsman of the Lord	with gilded banners bearing his token of the Ship and the Silver Swan	and a company of knights in full harness riding grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms	tall as lords	grey-eyed	dark-haired	singing as they came. NA NA						
And that was all	less than three thousands full told. NA NA														
No more would come. NA NA															
Their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the City and died away. NA NA															
The onlookers stood silent for a while. NA NA															
Dust hung in the air	for the wind had died and the evening was heavy. Metaphor NA														
Already the closing hour was drawing nigh	and the red sun had gone behind Mindolluin. NA NA														
Shadow came down on the City. NA NA															
Pippin looked up	and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey	as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them	and light came dully through it. Simile  NA												
But in the West the dying sun had set all the fume on fire	and now Mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers. NA NA														
‘So ends a fair day in wrath!’ he said	forgetful of the lad at his side. NA NA														
‘So it will	if I have not returned before the sundown-bells	’ said Bergil. NA NA													
‘Come! NA NA															
There goes the trumpet for the closing of the Gate.’ NA NA															
Hand in hand they went back into the City	the last to pass the Gate before it was shut; and as they reached the Lampwrights’ Street all the bells in the towers tolled solemnly. NA NA														
Lights sprang in many windows	and from the houses and 1010 wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of song. NA NA														
‘Farewell for this time	’ said Bergil. NA NA														
‘Take my greetings to my father	and thank him for the company that he sent. NA NA														
Come again soon	I beg. NA NA														
Almost I wish now that there was no war	for we might have had some merry times. NA NA														
We might have journeyed to Lossarnach	to my grandsire’s house; it is good to be there in spring	the woods and fields are full of flowers. NA NA													
But maybe we will go thither together yet. NA NA															
They will never overcome our Lord	and my father is very valiant. NA NA														
Farewell and return!’ NA NA															
They parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel. NA NA															
It seemed a long way	and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and dark. NA NA														
Not a star pricked the sky. NA NA															
He was late for the day-meal in the mess	and Beregond greeted him gladly	and sat him at his side to hear news of his son. NA NA													
After the meal Pippin stayed a while	and then took his leave	for a strange gloom was on him	and now he desired very much to see Gandalf again. Metaphor NA												
‘Can you find your way?’ said Beregond at the door of the small hall	on the north side of the citadel	where they had sat. NA NA													
‘It is a black night	and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the City	and none are to shine out from the walls. NA NA													
And I can give you news of another order: you will be summoned to the Lord Denethor early tomorrow. NA NA															
I fear you will not be for the Third Company. NA NA															
Still we may hope to meet again. NA NA															
Farewell and sleep in peace!’ NA NA															
The lodging was dark	save for a little lantern set on the table. NA NA														
Gandalf was not there. NA NA															
Gloom settled still more heavily on Pippin. Metaphor NA															
He climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window	but it was like looking into a pool of ink. Simile  NA														
He got down and closed the shutter and went to bed. NA NA															
For a while he lay and listened for sounds of Gandalf’s return	and then he fell into an uneasy sleep. NA NA														
In the night he was wakened by a light	and he saw that Gandalf had come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. NA NA														
There were candles on the minas tirith 1011 table and rolls of parchment. NA NA															
He heard the wizard sigh	and mutter: ‘When will Faramir return?’ NA NA														
‘Hullo!’ said Pippin	poking his head round the curtain. NA NA														
‘I thought you had forgotten all about me. NA NA															
I am glad to see you back. NA NA															
It has been a long day.’ NA NA															
‘But the night will be too short	’ said Gandalf. NA NA														
‘I have come back here	for I must have a little peace	alone. NA NA													
You should sleep	in a bed while you still may. NA NA														
At the sunrise I shall take you to the Lord Denethor again. NA NA															
No	when the summons comes	not at sunrise. NA NA													
The Darkness has begun. NA NA															
There will be no dawn.’ NA NA
